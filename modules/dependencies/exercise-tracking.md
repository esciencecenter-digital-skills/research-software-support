## Dependency tracking (10 minutes)

A common place to specify dependencies is in a file called `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` or `environment.yml`. 

Go into a source code repository of a piece of software you know and try to track down dependencies. Try to also find the soruce code of one of the dependencies and see if you can find the dependencies of this dependency. How many layers of this "dependency tree" can you follow?

You can also use one of the following projects:
