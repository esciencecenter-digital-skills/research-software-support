# Software Dependencies

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## What are software dependencies?

- A piece of software never operates in isolation. 
- Depends on other software (third party packages, libraries)
- Depends on system software (operating system, drivers, firmware)
- Depends on hardware (your computer and the chips inside, display)

note:
Software by nature always depends on other software and hardware.
