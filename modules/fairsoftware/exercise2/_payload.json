With each statement, identify the principle(s) it maps to, and the (sub)facet(s) of the principle(s) it addresses. A single statement may map to multiple (sub)facets.\n\n#### Example 1: [Comet](https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201200439)\n\n[Comet](https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201200439) is a command-line tool and desktop application for tandem mass spectrometry sequence database search6.\n\n- Comet is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source licence.\n- Comet is registered in the bio.tools catalogue of bioinformatics tools, where it has a globally unique and persistent identifier, and rich metadata that includes the identifier and is searchable and indexable.\n- The metadata in bio.tools is independent from the Comet repository, and will stay accessible should the software itself become inaccessible.\n- The publicly accessible project repository on GitHub includes detailed information about the development of Comet.\n- The code includes dependencies to external software packages, such as Thermo Scientificâ€™s MSFileReader library.\n- Comet can be downloaded via the browser following the links provided in the metadata using https.\n- Comet uses standard data types from the proteomics domain for its input and output data that are documented in the metadata as functional annotations.\n\n#### Example 2: [PureGoMe](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4337242)\n\n[PureGoMe](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4337242) is a project aimed at understanding Dutch public sentiment during the COVID-19 outbreak period by analysing real-time Twitter data.

It is used to process in-situ gamma-ray spectrometry measurements for luminescence dating.\n\n- gammaShiny has been deposited in the HAL French national archive and it has a persistent globally unique identifier, with the HAL identifier of the metadata record and a SWHID, identifying specifically the software artefact on the Software Heritage universal software source code archive.\n- Thanks to the HAL platform, where a licence is mandatory, gammaShiny is under a GNU General Public Licence v3.0.\n- The archived versions of gammaShinyâ€™s source code in Software Heritage include a codemeta.json
