important role in science. A first thought may be its role in data collection and analysis. Further, it may play a role in designing experiments, based on models generated. It may _be_ the experiment itself, simulate a research outcome based on data or ideas entered; it may also be the \"brain\" behind controlling crucial instrumentation.\n\nWhat scientific software can you think of?\n\nWhat role does it play?\n\nAn example here: the Event Horizon Telescope, which took a \"picture\" of a black hole.\nThe \"telescope\" is not a single tool, but complex: a \"planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes\" (wikipedia).\nThe separate telescopes collect data that is synchronized with atomic clocks, and the data is combined at highly specialised supercomputers.\nThe data can be converted into an image using custom software.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n\u003Ccenter>\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/definition.png\" width=\"55%\">\n\u003C/center>\n\n\u003Csmall>definition of Research Software from the FAIR4RS working group\u003C/small>\n\nNote:\n\nA definition of research software, from the FAIR4RS working group.\nIt is important that not all software that is used in research is research software.\nFor example, a text editor that is used to write a paper is not research software.\nNor is powerpoint, a web browser, or the software used to guide the telescope.\nEven tools like R or Python are not necessarily research software.\nThe code written in R or Python for an analysis would be research software, however.\nJust like a custom-made Excel macro that is used to analyse data.\nOr a custom-made web application that is used to collect data.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n\u003Ccenter>\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/unescoopenscience.png\" width=\"50%\">\n\u003C/center>\n\n\u003Csmall>[UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, 2021](https://creativecommons.org/2021/12/02/unesco-recommendation-on-open-science-ratified/) (CC BY IGO 3.0)\u003C/small>\n\nNote:\nOpen Science encompasses many aspects of science.\nIt is a movement that aims to make science — which includes software — more open, transparent, and accessible.\nThis is supported by many organisations, including UNESCO.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## The FAIR principles\n\n\u003Ccenter>\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/fair.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\u003C/center>\n\nNote:\nthe FAIR principles standardize values that help openness, transparency, and accessibility.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n![screenshot Wilkinson 2016](media/fairwilkinson.png)\n\nNote:\nFAIR principles were originally designed for data, but are also applicable to software.\nDesigned also with other digital objects in mind, though actual description was data-specific.\nThis has been extended meanwhile.\n\n===\n\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software is not data\n\nSoftware is...\n\n- **complex**: code is creatively generated, interconnected and multi-layered\n- **interdependent**: it builds upon and therefore depends on other software\n- **executable**: it is not static, but can be run\n- **dynamic**: it can break over time, and versioning is common\n\nNote:\nWhile technically, software is a special kind of data (in that it is representation of information in a digital state), they are in essence quite different.\n\nSoftware and data both are digital objects, sharing certain characteristics: they can be assigned a DOI, and they can have a license.\n\nSoftware is quite different from data, however. Consider:\n\n- Complexity; it is not a single file, but a collection of files that are interconnected and multi-layered, and do not necessarily stand on their own. Software is also the result of a creative process that provides a tool to do something, and not the result of a measurement or observation.\n- Interdependence; software is often built using other software, and rarely built completely from scratch. This makes it dependent on other existing applications, which themselves may also change over time.\n- Executability; software is in its dryest form a set of instructions that can be an archive of a procedure. However, the main goal of software is that these instructions can be executed. Data, by contrast, stand on their own.\n- Dynamic vs static; its interdependence and context-dependency drives software to require maintenance to retain its value, and this maintenance is not straightforward. Maintenance is also counter to academic culture; it does not fit in existing structures (both in terms of reward/recognition, but also in terms of funding and understanding of what is needed). Versioning of software is very common, while data is often static (though versions may happen).\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software opportunities\n\n- Software is a **living thing**\n- Creative process allows for **early adoption** of good practices\n- Openness and transparency are **inherent** to software\n\n\nNote:\nThe different nature of software also provides opportunities.\nSoftware is a living thing, and therefore it is easier to adopt good practices early on.\nCrucially, there is a community driven openness in software that long predates the open science movement.\nThis is not to say that software is inherently open, but that there is a broad open culture, which also comes with existing tools and pathways to facilitate openness and transparency.\nConsider GitHub (and other code hosting platforms), which are designed for this purpose.\nConsider also version control software, a good software development practice that builds in provenance.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n![FAIR for Research Software paper](media/fair4rs_paper.png)\n\nFair 4 Research Software (FAIR4RS) working group (2022)\n[doi:10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)\n\n![Contributing Organizations](media/fair4rs_logos.png)\n\nNote:\nIn 2022, the results of extensive community consultation were published in the FAIR for Research Software paper.\nThe group behind this was a collaboration between the Research Software Alliance, the Research Data Alliance, and FORCE11.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n![FAIR for Research Software principles](media/fair4rs_principles.png)\n\nNote:\nThese are the interpretations given to the FAIR principles for software by the working group.\nIn many cases these are rephrased to better fit software, but in some cases they are also extended.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Findability\n\n![FAIR4RS Findability](media/fair4rs_F.png)\n\n- Archive on Zenodo for DOI and persistence\u003Cbr />\n  \u003Csmall> Note that persistence on GitHub is not guaranteed!\u003C/small>\n- Use (semantic) versioning with updates\u003Cbr />\n  \u003Csmall> Zenodo assigns a DOI to each version \u003C/small>\n- Include metadata, explicitly containing the DOI\u003Cbr />\n  \u003Csmall> but also license, version, dependencies, etc. \u003C/small>\n- Register the software in a community registry\u003Cbr />\n  \u003Csmall> such as PyPI or CRAN, depending on the language/domain \u003C/small>\n\nNote:\nFor software findability, a few things need to work together:\n\nThe software needs to be archived on a platform that provides a DOI and persistence. GitHub is not guaranteed to provide this, and while it is a useful tool is not a suitable archive for software.\nGitHub does work well together with Zenodo, which provides both.\nTogether they also provide functionality for versioning: when releasing a new version on GitHub, and using the Zenodo integration, Zenodo will update the entry and assign a new DOI to the new version.\n\nFor software-specific findability, though, Zenodo is insufficient. Here, you can think of more specific registries, such as PyPI, CRAN, or Bioconductor; depending on the language and domain of the software.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Accessibility\n\n![FAIR4RS Accessibility](media/fair4rs_A.png)\n\n- Community registries provide standard download protocols\u003Cbr />\n  \u003Csmall> e.g. `pip install my_software` \u003C/small>\n- Metadata on Zenodo is part of the persistent archive\n\nNote:\nA lot of accessibility is covered by the findability principles, but there are a few additional things to consider.\nSpecifically, software may still be FAIR as long as its metadata is accessible.\nThe code of the software itself, not the actual functional engine, could be considered metadata.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Interoperability\n\n![FAIR4RS Interoperability](media/fair4rs_I.png)\n\n- Input and output both needs to meet community standards\u003Cbr />\n  \u003Csmall> e.g. file formats, data models, ontologies \u003C/small>\n- References to external objects should be unambiguous\u003Cbr />\n  \u003Csmall> use URLs, DOIs, version numbers etc. \u003C/small>\n\nNote:\nAs with data, interoperability refers partly to formats and standards (in this case: inputs, outputs, or other objects used). For example CSV, JSON, and XML are interoperable formats, while PDF is not.\nThese standards may also be domain-specific, such as the use of ontologies in the life sciences.\n\nThe second sub-principle refers to the use of unambiguous references to external objects, such as libraries, data, or models.
