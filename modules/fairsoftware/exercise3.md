# Exercise 2

## FAIR in practice

Role playing exercise:
One person presents the software, the other person gives feedback.

Tasks for presenter:

- What is the software about?
- Who will use it?
- What is the expected lifecycle of the software?
- What potential users or applications are untapped?

Tasks for reviewer:

- Which FAIR principles are addressed?
- How can the software be made more FAIR?
- What would be the next step (low-hanging fruit)?

Together:

- Define the next steps for the software


Goals:

- Frame an assessment positively: always start with assessing the things that have been done that contribute to good management and FAIR software. This is crucial, as well as motivating.
