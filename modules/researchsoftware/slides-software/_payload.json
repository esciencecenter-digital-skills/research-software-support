The software is stored in memory and on a hard disk rather than on cardboard (remember, one card per line...). Modern software often builds on other software, or used specific parts of other software packages, rather than re-defining the wheel.\n\nHowever, it ultimately still basically does the same: Software is a set of instructions that tells hardware what to do.\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n\n## Complexity of modern software\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/VScode_snapshot.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\u003Csmall>Screenshot of source code for \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank2\">DeepRank2\u003C/a>\u003C/small>\n\n\u003C!-- Speaker notes -->\nNote:\nIn this image, we can get a glimpse of the complexity of modern software. We can see that software has a certain structure (indicated by differently colored text), is often composed of many lines of code (right side of image shows the entire length of the code), and is split over multiple intercommunicating files (left).\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n\n## Software is a form of data\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/data_definition.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\u003Csmall>Definition by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data/\">Merriam Webster English Dictionary\u003C/a>\u003C/small>\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software is data\n\nSoftware can be ...\n\n- stored as bits\n- read, loaded, and processed\n- input and/or output\n- can be assigned a DOI, licence, etc\n\n\u003C!-- Speaker notes -->\nNote:\n- Software is stored as bits and read from disk, loaded into memory, and processed similar to other types of data. \n- Software can be input, and software can be output. In fact, one of the major breakthroughs in computer science was when people realized that the instructions of the machine could be handled and stored the same as the data that it operated on. \n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## BUT\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software is a special type of data\n\nSoftware is...\n\n- **complex**: it is creatively generated, interconnected, and multi-layered\n- **interdependent**: it builds upon and therefore depends on other software (and data)\n- **executable**: it needs to be run to have a value (e.g. to process data)\n- **dynamic**: it can (and will) break soon and therefore needs to be regularly updated \n\n\u003C!-- Speaker notes -->\nNote:\nWhile technically, software is a special kind of data (in that it is representation of information in a digital state), they are in essence quite different.\n\n- Complexity; it is not a single file, but a collection of files that are interconnected and multi-layered, and do not necessarily stand on their own. Software is also the result of a creative process that provides a tool to do something, and not the result of a measurement or observation.\n- Interdependence; software is often built using other software, and rarely built completely from scratch. This makes it dependent on other existing applications, which themselves may also change over time. In the context of research software it also often depends on the data, data formats, data standards, metadata, etc, which also change when new equipment becomes available.\n- Executability; software is in its dryest form a set of instructions that can be an archive of a procedure. However, the main goal of software is that these instructions can be executed. While most forms of data can stand on their own (e.g. I can look at the list of ages of all the people in a room and make conclusions about average age, etc.), software cannot be directly interpreted (only in the context of what it does).\n- Dynamic vs static; its interdependence and context-dependency drives software to require maintenance to retain its value, and this maintenance is not straightforward. Versioning of software is very common, while data is often static (though versions may happen).\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software requires dedicated maintenance\n\n- Software needs to be actively maintained to remain useable.\n  -
