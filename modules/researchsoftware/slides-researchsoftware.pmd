Note:

Software plays an important role in science. A first thought may be its role in data collection and analysis. Further, it may play a role in designing experiments, based on models generated. It may _be_ the experiment itself, simulate a research outcome based on data or ideas entered; it may also be the "brain" behind controlling crucial instrumentation.

What scientific software can you think of?

What role does it play?

An example here: the Event Horizon Telescope, which took a "picture" of a black hole.
The "telescope" is not a single tool, but complex: a "planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes" (wikipedia).
The separate telescopes collect data that is synchronized with atomic clocks, and the data is combined at highly specialised supercomputers.
The data can be converted into an image using custom software.

<small>definition of Research Software from the FAIR4RS working group</small>

Note:

A definition of research software, from the FAIR4RS working group.
It is important that not all software that is used in research is research software.
For example, a text editor that is used to write a paper is not research software.
Nor is powerpoint, a web browser, or the software used to guide the telescope.
Even tools like R or Python are not necessarily research software.
The code written in R or Python for an analysis would be research software, however.
Just like a custom-made Excel macro that is used to analyse data.
Or a custom-made web application that is used to collect data.

## Why the distinction?

- Research software is an important asset and output of research
- Enable proper attribution
- Increase Findability and Reuse

Note:

The distinction is important

## Take home messages

- Software is an important part of research
- Not all software used in research is research software
- It is important to regard research software in the whole research lifecycle
