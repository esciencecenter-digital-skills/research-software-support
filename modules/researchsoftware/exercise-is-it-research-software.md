## Exercise: Is it research software?

Using the definition of research software from the FAIR4RS working group, try to classify the following as "research software" or "software in research"

### Example software tools

#### Shape Preserving Local Histogram Modification Algorithm
[An Analysis and Implementation of the Shape Preserving Local Histogram Modification Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.5201/ipol.2018.236) is a published article on [IPOL](https://www.ipol.im/). The source code implementing the algorithm is available for download.

Is this "research software" or "software in research"?

#### SciPy
[SciPy](https://zbmath.org/software/6293) is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
It is also the name of a very popular conference on scientific programming with Python. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation.
The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge.
NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the worldâ€™s leading scientists and engineers.

Is this "research software" or "software in research"?

### Other software tools
How about other software tools you are familiar with?
Can you provide an example of software you are familiar with, and then classify it as "research software" or "software in research"?
