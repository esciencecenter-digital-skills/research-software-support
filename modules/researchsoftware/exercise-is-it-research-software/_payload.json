Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n",{"_path":251,"_dir":121,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":502,"description":559,"order":109,"body":560,"_type":111,"_id":818,"_source":113,"_file":819,"_stem":820,"_extension":116,"plainText":821},"These yellow pages are work in progress and will keep expanding.
