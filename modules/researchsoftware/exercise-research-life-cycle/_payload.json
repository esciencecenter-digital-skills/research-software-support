Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n",{"_path":280,"_dir":152,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":530,"description":587,"order":140,"body":588,"_type":142,"_id":846,"_source":144,"_file":847,"_stem":848,"_extension":147,"plainText":849},"These yellow pages are work in progress and will keep expanding.
