Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Explore software management plans fitting your piece of software by using the [Exploring the SMP Questionnaire](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/smp_questionnaire) exercise in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan and download the Word file.\n",{"_path":280,"_dir":152,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":530,"description":587,"order":140,"body":588,"_type":142,"_id":856,"_source":144,"_file":857,"_stem":858,"_extension":147,"plainText":859},"These yellow pages are work in progress and will keep expanding.
