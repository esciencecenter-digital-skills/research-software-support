## University software policy (30 minutes)
It is important that the copyright holder (the university!) has a policy on software licensing, to allow their researchers to share software with an open license. [TU Delft has such a policy](https://zenodo.org/record/4629662), as does [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/licensing). Does your university or institution have a software policy?

#### You should now be able to...
- Know what factors motivate the creation of a software policy
- Know some licenses that are recommended by research institutions, and their motivation.
