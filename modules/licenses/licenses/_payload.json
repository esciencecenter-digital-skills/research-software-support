They therefore prefer copyleft licenses, because those ensure that as many software packages (and therefore, users) as possible are free.\n\nOpen Source takes a more pragmatic approach in assuming that most software is made by a small cadre of software developers, often employed by companies, and that there are a potentially large number of end users that have neither the skills nor the inclination to change what their computer does. For these end users, having the source code is not useful, but the developers can often save some effort by working together on software that everyone needs. A permissive Open Source license makes that possible with a minimal amount of legal complexity. It also makes it easy to build commercial, proprietary products on top of the software.\n\nFrom the perspective of science, there's something to be said for each of these approaches. On the one hand, Free Software and copyleft matches the ideals of Open Science quite well. On the other hand, science and scientific software development is funded by society using public funds in the hopes that something useful will come out of it, and scientific papers are useless to most citizens. They want a product, which will be produced commercially, and that is a good match for the Open Source and permissive licensing model.\n\n",[380,415],{"_path":381,"_dir":382,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":383,"description":7,"body":384,"_type":373,"_id":412,"_source":375,"_file":413,"_extension":377,"plainText":414},"/main/about","main","About",{"type":12,"children":385,"toc":408},[386,392,397,403],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":387,"children":389},{"id":388},"about-the-research-software-support",[390],{"type":21,"value":391},"About the Research Software Support",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":393,"children":394},{},[395],{"type":21,"value":396},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.",{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":398,"children":400},{"id":399},"target-audience",[401],{"type":21,"value":402},"Target audience",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":404,"children":405},{},[406],{"type":21,"value":407},"The target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":189,"depth":189,"links":409},[410,411],{"id":388,"depth":189,"text":391},{"id":399,"depth":189,"text":402},"local_fs:main:about.md","main/about.md","---\ntitle: About\n---\n\n## About the Research Software Support\nIn the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\n\n## Target audience\n\nThe target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"_path":416,"_dir":382,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":417,"description":7,"body":418,"_type":373,"_id":542,"_source":375,"_file":543,"_extension":377,"plainText":544},"/main/contribute","Contribute",{"type":12,"children":419,"toc":537},[420,426,431,437,442],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":421,"children":423},{"id":422},"contributing-to-the-research-software-support",[424],{"type":21,"value":425},"Contributing to the Research Software Support",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":427,"children":428},{},[429],{"type":21,"value":430},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\nThis, as you can imagine, is no easy feat, and we need your help!\nSo first of all, thank you very much for your interest in contributing to this project.",{"type":15,"tag":44,"props":432,"children":434},{"id":433},"what-can-i-do",[435],{"type":21,"value":436},"What can I do?",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":438,"children":439},{},[440],{"type":21,"value":441},"Go to our github repository by clicking on the GitHub logo in the top right of this website.",{"type":15,"tag":97,"props":443,"children":444},{},[445,461,502,525],{"type":15,"tag":101,"props":446,"children":447},{},[448,450,459],{"type":21,"value":449},"Contribute to the content discussion in the ",{"type":15,"tag":451,"props":452,"children":456},"a",{"href":453,"rel":454},"https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astory",[455],"nofollow",[457],{"type":21,"value":458},"chapter issues",{"type":21,"value":460},", e.g. by listing good resources for information.",{"type":15,"tag":101,"props":462,"children":463},{},[464,470,472],{"type":15,"tag":451,"props":465,"children":467},{"href":466},"#elements-of-a-module",[468],{"type":21,"value":469},"Author a lesson",{"type":21,"value":471},", e.g. by:\n",{"type":15,"tag":97,"props":473,"children":474},{},[475,484,493],{"type":15,"tag":101,"props":476,"children":477},{},[478],{"type":15,"tag":451,"props":479,"children":481},{"href":480},"#slides",[482],{"type":21,"value":483},"Creating slides",{"type":15,"tag":101,"props":485,"children":486},{},[487],{"type":15,"tag":451,"props":488,"children":490},{"href":489},"#exercises",[491],{"type":21,"value":492},"Designing an exercise",{"type":15,"tag":101,"props":494,"children":495},{},[496],{"type":15,"tag":451,"props":497,"children":499},{"href":498},"#online-resources",[500],{"type":21,"value":501},"Curating online resources",{"type":15,"tag":101,"props":503,"children":504},{},[505,507,514,516,523],{"type":21,"value":506},"Review a lesson module;
