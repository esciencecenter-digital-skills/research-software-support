On the one hand, Free Software and copyleft matches the ideals of Open Science quite well. On the other hand, science and scientific software development is funded by society using public funds in the hopes that something useful will come out of it, and scientific papers are useless to most citizens. They want a product, which will be produced commercially, and that is a good match for the Open Source and permissive licensing model.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":56,"depth":56,"links":532},[533],{"id":187,"depth":56,"text":190,"children":534},[535,536,537,538],{"id":214,"depth":336,"text":217},{"id":254,"depth":336,"text":257},{"id":305,"depth":336,"text":308},{"id":512,"depth":336,"text":515},"github:modules:licenses:licenses.md","modules/licenses/licenses.md",{"_path":542,"_dir":5,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":543,"description":7,"body":544,"_type":59,"_id":683,"_source":61,"_file":684,"_extension":63},"/modules/licenses/university_policy","UniversityPolicy",{"type":10,"children":545,"toc":676},[546,552,557,562,567,573,599,605,627,633],{"type":13,"tag":14,"props":547,"children":549},{"id":548},"university-software-policies",[550],{"type":19,"value":551},"University software policies",{"type":13,"tag":22,"props":553,"children":554},{},[555],{"type":19,"value":556},"Universities employ researchers, who often create and use software in the course of doing research.
