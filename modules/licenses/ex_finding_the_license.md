## Exercise 1: Find the license for a software package (10 minutes)

Imagine that a researcher comes to you and asks whether they can use a particular software package that they found online. One aspect to consider would be its license, if there is one.

Pick a software package from the following list, and try to find out whether it has a license and if so which. The idea is to cover the list together, so let's not all start at the top!

- Kernel Tuner
- nodal-dg
- OpenFOAM
- MATLAB
- COPASI
- Glotaran
- LinkAhead
