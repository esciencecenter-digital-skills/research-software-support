Sharing scientific software is sometimes simple from a legal perspective, but it can also be quite complicated. This section explains the main issues to take into account, which are ownership of the copyright, constraints imposed by dependencies, and choosing a license.\n\n### Ownership\n\nA copyright license must be given by the owner(s) of the copyright being licensed. This means that the first step to licensing a program is to find those owners. In most countries, including The Netherlands, any work you do as part of your tasks as an employee of an organisation belongs to your employer, not to you. After all, they're paying you to do the work.

If it is not possible to determine the owners of the copyright, then the software cannot be licensed.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nOwners may not be completely free to decide how to license their software. Aside from any constraints imposed by funders, *dependencies* play a role. Dependencies are externally developed, separate software packages that are needed for the software to work. Having such dependencies is very common, and dependencies typically have their own dependencies, so that any complete computer program consists of a whole collection of software packages, usually written by different people.
