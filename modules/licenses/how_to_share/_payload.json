Sharing scientific software is sometimes simple from a legal perspective, but it can also be quite complicated. This section explains the main issues to take into account, which are ownership of the copyright, constraints imposed by dependencies, and choosing a license.\n\n### Ownership\n\nA copyright license must be given by the owner(s) of the copyright being licensed. This means that the first step to licensing a program is to find those owners. In most countries, including The Netherlands, any work you do as part of your tasks as an employee of an organisation belongs to your employer, not to you. After all, they're paying you to do the work. This means that the copyright on any software written by a university employee is owned by the university.\n\nIf the software to be shared is written entirely by one person, with no copy-pasting of code from others, and no help from people outside of the organisation, then the copyright is therefore owned by your organisation, and it can decide how to license the code.\n\nScience is often done collaboratively though, and that makes things a bit more complicated. Funding for research is often given to consortia comprising multiple organisations that will collaboratively execute the research project.

If it is not possible to determine the owners of the copyright, then the software cannot be licensed.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nOwners may not be completely free to decide how to license their software. Aside from any constraints imposed by funders, *dependencies* play a role. Dependencies are externally developed, separate software packages that are needed for the software to work. Having such dependencies is very common, and dependencies typically have their own dependencies, so that any complete computer program consists of a whole collection of software packages, usually written by different people.

Find a piece of research software that you like (because of the topic or nice picture, or whetever other reason) from the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/software?page=1&rows=48).\n\n1. Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2.
