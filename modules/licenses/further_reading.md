## Software licenses
Follow the links below to read about different open licenses.

### The Turing Way (20 minutes)
Read in the Turing Way about [Software licenses](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-software.html) , as well as [Data licenses](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-data.html) and [Machine Learning Model licenses](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ml.html). It is good to realize that these are different in ways that are relevant for re-use, that need to be covered specifically in a license.

### Choose a license (10 minutes)
By now you will have a good idea of what Open Source licenses are available. [Choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) tries to simplify the choice between them, and is an excellent resource to be aware of and recommend to others.

#### You should now be able to...
- Understand the difference between open and proprietary licenses
- Understand the difference between permissive and viral (or copyleft) free licenses
- Know the main Creative Commons permission marks (BY/SA/NC/ND)
- Understand what it means for something to be "in the public domain"
- Know that ML models, software, and data place different requirements on their respective licenses.

## License compatibility

Follow the links below to read about the compatibility of different open licenses.

### License compatibility (15 minutes)
What happens when software licenses meet? To start understanding the concept of license compatibility, [this blog post on mend.io is a good start](https://www.mend.io/resources/blog/license-compatibility/).

### License compatibility in-depth case study (optional; 20 minutes)
The Turing Way also discusses license compatibility with [an excellent in-depth analysis of a case study](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-compatibility.html). While this chapter is very informative, it goes quite deep into a specific case study, so it should be seen as illustrative rather than necessary background reading.

#### You should now be able to...
- Explain what license compatibility means
- Roughly know which open source licenses mix, and which do not.

## University software policy (30 minutes)
It is important that the copyright holder (the university!) has a policy on software licensing, to allow their researchers to share software with an open license. [TU Delft has such a policy](https://zenodo.org/record/4629662), as does [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/licensing). Does your university or institution have a software policy?

#### You should now be able to...
- Know what factors motivate the creation of a software policy
- Know some licenses that are recommended by research institutions, and their motivation.
