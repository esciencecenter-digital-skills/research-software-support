## Exercise 1: Does your university have a software licensing policy?

Try and find out whether your university has a software (licensing) policy. If you can find it, compare it with the ones from [TU Delft](https://zenodo.org/record/4629662), [ASTRON](https://zenodo.org/records/7307162) and [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nlesc_ip_policy_2017.pdf). What elements are commonly found? Which differences do you see, and what is their respective motivation?
