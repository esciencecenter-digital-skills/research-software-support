## Exercise 1: Choose a license for or using your policy (10 minutes)

One of the concerns typically addressed in a software policy is licensing of software developed at the institution. Policies can choose a single license, or offer a range of options.

Try to find out whether your university has a license policy. What does it say about which license(s) to use? If you don't have a policy yet, which license(s) would you choose for your policy? Why?

Go to [Choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) and play around with the options to help you choose.
