This whole collection needs to be reproduced on the computer of the user for things to work. There are two ways of doing that: \n\n1) combining them all together on the computer of the developer, and then wrapping everything up into a package, installer, container image, or VM image that is sent to the user, or \n2) putting the components that you made yourself on the Internet (as a package), and relying on the user to download the other components (packages) and assembling it all together into a working application\n\n## Monolithic applications\n\nOption 1) works for applications, which are more or less independent.
