---

## Why document projects?

- Quickly get users started
- Show how to use the software
- Explain concepts behind the software
- Describe internal machinery of a project

## Types of documentation

Documentation serves different goals, therefore there are different types: 
- **Tutorials**: learning-oriented, allows the newcomer to get started
- **How-to guides**: goal-oriented, shows how to solve a specific problem
- **Explanation**: understanding-oriented, explains a concept
- **Reference**: information-oriented, describes the machinery

## README file: (how-to guide)
- First thing a user/collaborator sees
- Contains basic setup instructions and information about the project

## In-code documentation (reference)
- Technical documentation in the code
- For example ```# comments```

## API reference (reference)
- API reference: detailed description of how each function/class in the code can be used
