- _Microsoft Word_ - text editor (used to write the paper, take notes)
- _Git_ - version control software
- _NumPy_ - Python math library (used in nearly all Python-based research software)
- _ESMValTool_ - diagnostic tool/library for Earth System Models (Used in many climate research projects)
- _ClimAn_ - your own domain specific python library (defines various analytical functions that you used in your climate research)
- The original code on which you based your library _ClimAn_
- Your own local Python script, used to execute the analysis

Which software would you cite and which not? Why?
