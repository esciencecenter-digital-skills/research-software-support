From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n",{"_path":261,"_dir":129,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":511,"description":568,"order":11,"body":569,"_type":119,"_id":826,"_source":121,"_file":827,"_stem":828,"_extension":124,"plainText":829},"These yellow pages are work in progress and will keep expanding.
