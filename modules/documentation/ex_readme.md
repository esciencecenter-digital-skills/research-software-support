# Improve a README

The README file is usually the first thing users/collaborators see when visiting your GitHub repository.
Use it to communicate important information about your project! For many smaller or mid-size projects, this is enough documentation.
It’s not that hard to make a basic one, and it’s easy to expand as needed.
