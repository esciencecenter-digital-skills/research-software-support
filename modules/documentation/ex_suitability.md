# What is suitable documentation?

## Step 1: Choose a software project

Choose a software project for this exercise, preferably one you are familiar with.

If you don't have a project in mind, you can use one of the following:
- [Democracy Topic Modelling](https://research-software-directory.org/software/democracy-topic-modelling)
- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [Haddock](https://research-software-directory.org/software/haddock3)
- [worcs](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html)

## Step 2: Discuss type(s) of documentation

*Look at the software repository or page in the Research Software Directory*

- Is documentation for this project important? Why?
- How would you describe a useful documentation for this project?
- How can you motivate your colleagues to contribute to the documentation?

*What type of documentation seems appropriate to you?*

- User documentation
- Developer documentation
- Deployment documentation

*Which content would you include?*
The following (non-exhaustive) list of documentation items:

- Purpose
- Authors
- License
- Recommended citation
- Copy-paste-able example to get started
- Dependencies and their versions or version ranges
- Installation instructions
- Tutorials covering key functionality
- Reference documentation (e.g. API) covering all functionality
- How you want to be asked questions (mailing list or forum or chat or issue tracker)
- Possibly a FAQ section
- Contribution guide
