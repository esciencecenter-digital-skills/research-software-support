Explains decisions we made\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\"  -->\n\n## When **not** to use in-code documentation?\n\n+ When the code is self-explanatory\n+ To replace good variable/function names\n+ To replace version control\n+ To keep old (zombie) code around\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\"  -->\n\n## Readable code vs commented code\n\n```python=\n# convert from degrees celsius to fahrenheit\ndef convert(d):\n    return d * 5 / 9 + 32\n```\nvs\n```python=\ndef celsius_to_fahrenheit(degrees):\n    return degrees * 5 / 9 +

Which one do you prefer?\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\"  -->\n\n## Docstrings: a special kind of comment\n\n```python=\ndef celsius_to_fahrenheit(degrees):\n  \"\"\"Convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.\"\"\"\n  return degrees * 5 / 9 + 32\n```\n\nWhy is this OK?\n\nNote:\nDocstrings can be used to generate user documentation.\nThey are accessible outside the code.\nThey follow a standardized syntax.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\"  -->\n\n## In-code commenting: key points\n\n+ Explicit, descriptive naming already provides important documentation.\n+ Comments should describe the why for your code, not the what.\n+ Writing docstrings is an easy way to write documentation while you code, as they are accessible outside the code itself.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\"  -->\n\n## User/API documentation\n\n+ What if a README file is not enough?\n+ How do I easily create user documentation?\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\"  -->\n\n## Tools\n\n+ **Sphinx** (documentation generator)\n  - creates nicely-formatted HTML pages out of .md or .rst files\n  - programming language independent\n+ **Github pages** (deploy your documentation)\n  - set up inside your GitHub repository\n  - automatically deploys your Sphinx-generated documentation\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Take-home message\n\n+ Depending on the purpose and state of the project documentation needs to meet different criteria.\n+ Documentation can take different shapes:\n  + Readable code\n  + In-code comments\n  + Docstrings\n  + README files\n  + Tutorials/notebooks\n+ Documentation is a vital part of a project, and should be kept and created alongside the corresponding code.\n",[665,700],{"_path":666,"_dir":667,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":668,"description":7,"body":669,"_type":658,"_id":697,"_source":660,"_file":698,"_extension":662,"plainText":699},"/main/about","main","About",{"type":14,"children":670,"toc":693},[671,677,682,688],{"type":17,"tag":29,"props":672,"children":674},{"id":673},"about-the-research-software-support",[675],{"type":22,"value":676},"About
