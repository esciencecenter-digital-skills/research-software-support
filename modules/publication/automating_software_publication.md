# Automating software publication

Most of the steps in the modern software publishing pipeline can be automated.

### An example with GitHub-Zenodo integration
1. Choose a software repository on GitHub that you own (either existing, or create a new one).
2. Navigate to [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/)
3. Log in with your Zenodo account (create a new one if necessary)
4. Navigate to the "GitHub" tab, located in a drop-down menu under your username
5. Follow the instructions there to link your GitHub account with Zenodo (if not already done)
6. Look through the list of repositories listed until you find the one you wanted to archive
7. Flip the toggle on the right to "ON"
8. Go back to your repository on github.com and make a new release. Zenodo will automatically archive this release.
9. Add the Zenodo badge for your repository to the README file.
