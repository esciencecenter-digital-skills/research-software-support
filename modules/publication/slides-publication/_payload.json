Software\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Before we dive in...\n\nWhat do you already know about software publication?\n\nNote: Let participants discuss how they would publish a piece of software.\n\nAnswers can potentially be collected in a collaborative document.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## What do we mean by publishing?\n\n* Publishing the *software itself* (not just publishing an article *about* it)\n* There are many ways to do this\n\nNote:\n\nThis generally means the source code itself, ideally including instructions on how to use it, what dependencies it has on other software, etc.\n\nThe goal is to allow others to find and use your code, if they so wish, without extreme levels of difficulty.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Why Publish?\n\n* Major scientific considerations \n    * Citability\n    * Reproducibility\n* FAIRness\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/fair.png\" width=\"30%\">\n\nNote:\n\n**Citability** - Allows the software authors to get credit for their work\n\n**Reproducibility** - If software is not published anywhere then few people will successfully reproduce analyses, simulations or other research results that were performed by other researchers\n\nAdditionally, publishing is essential for meeting the FAIR principles:\n\n**Findability** - if software lives on someone's hard drive then it cannot be easily found by anyone\n\n**Accessibility** - the software can e.g. be downloaded and installed using a standard protocol (authentication is still a possibility)\n\n**Interoperability** - publishing the dependencies (e.g. software libraries) and input/output formats and versions is necessary for interoperability\n\n**Reusability** - it's only reusable if it's available, and if people know what they are allowed to do with it (based on its software license)\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Traditional publishing pipeline\n\n* Write some code and leave it on your hard drive\n* Generate scientific results with it\n* Write a paper about those results\n* Possibly not even mentioning the software at all\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Consequences\n\n* The software itself is not citable\n* Methods are not easily reproduced or even analysed\n* Nobody else can build on top of your research\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## Modern publishing pipeline\n\n* Software repository\n* Tag/semantic versioning\n* Get a persistent identifier\n* Registries\n* Software Paper\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Software repository\n\nPut all source files in a public version-controlled repository\ne.g. GitHub, GitLab\n\n* Software is immediately Findable\n* Naturally contains a log of all development history\n\nInclude a software license, and a citation.cff file\n\nNote:\n\nSee license, citation and software management chapters\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Software repository\nWhich one?\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/repository_logos.png\" width=\"80%\">\n\nNote:\n\nAnything is better than nothing. GitLab and GitHub are the mainstream, used by many and with lots of features. You might run into projects using other repositories. \n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Tag/semantic versioning\n\nIt is important to communicate the actual version of the software used for a particular piece of research\n\nIf your software is used as a dependency of another software/workflow then specific versions can be referenced\n\nIdeally, use \"semantic versioning\" in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. v2.1.5)\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Get a Persistent Identifier\n\nSpecific versions of the software should be published to an archiving service that provides persistent identifiers.\n\nFor example, Zenodo is a long term archiving service for scientific data and software.\nZenodo will assign a **D**igital **O**bject **I**dentifyer (**DOI**) to the published data, making it citable.\n\nNote:\n\nSee Citation story\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Registries\nAdd a link to your software on a relevant public registry\n\n* For example, the eScience Center maintains the Research Software Directory\n* Can also be domain specific software registries\n* Or even list it on awesomelist\n\nThis aids greatly in Findability by relevant researchers\n\nNote:\nAn \"awesome list\" is a list of awesome things curated by the community, often hosted as a repository on GitHub.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### The Research Software Directory\n\u003Cstyle>\n.container{\n  display: flex;\n  text-align: start;\n}\n.col{\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\u003C/style>\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"container\">\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/rsd-front-page.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the front page of the RSD\">\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"col\" style=\"font-size: x-large\">\nThe Research Software Directory is an online service designed to \u003Cb>collect\u003C/b> and \u003Cb>present\u003C/b> “related research information” in a structured way.
