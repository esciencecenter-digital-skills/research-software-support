# Register your software in the Research Software Directory

For this exercise, you will create a practice software page on the  [RSD playground](https://research-software.dev/). This playground will be cleared at some point after this course, so don't try to make it too perfect.

First, think of a software package of yourself to make a page out of. If you don't have one available, choose one of the examples below and try to mimic it:

- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [Kernel Tuner](https://research-software-directory.org/software/kernel-tuner)
- [Citation File Format](https://research-software-directory.org/software/citation-file-format)
- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [NEBULA](https://research-software-directory.org/software/nebula)
- [Chemistry Development Kit](https://research-software-directory.org/software/cdk)
- [Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM)](https://research-software-directory.org/software/pism)
- [GGIR](https://research-software-directory.org/software/ggir)
- [DeepRank](https://research-software-directory.org/software/deeprank)

Sign in with a 'local account' (by entering any username you want), click on the plus sign on the top right and select 'New Software'.

The goal is to get familiar with all aspects of creating a software page, so don't try to add e.g. 20 contributors to a page, but just add a few and try out all features.
