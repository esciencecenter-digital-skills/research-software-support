# Exercise: Find your registry

Software registries are an important player in the findability of research software.
A collection of software registries can be found here: [Research Software Registries Awesome List](https://github.com/NLeSC/awesome-research-software-registries)

Choose a piece of research software that you know, or pick one of the packages in this list:

- [Xenon](https://research-software-directory.org/software/xenon)
- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [RS-DAT](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/rs-dat)
- [Haddock](https://research-software-directory.org/software/haddock3)
- [worcs](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html)

In teams:
1. Find out what the software is about if you don't already know.
2. Look by yourself (without looking at your team mates) in the [Research Software Registries Awesome List](https://github.com/NLeSC/awesome-research-software-registries) for a registry that is suitable for your chosen piece of software.
3. Discuss with your partner(s) why you chose that registry.
4. Investigate the requirements for your chosen registry. What should the software and its documentation adhere to, to be added to the registry?
