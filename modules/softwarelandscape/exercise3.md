## Exercise: Role playing exercise (15 minutes)
Pick a piece of software you know of or pick one from the following examples:

- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [LitStudy](https://research-software-directory.org/software/litstudy)
- [Haddock](https://research-software-directory.org/software/haddock3)
- [WORCS](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html)
- [Democracy Topic Modelling](https://research-software-directory.org/software/democracy-topic-modelling)


One person (the researcher) takes some time to prepare to present a piece of software, while the other person reads up on the [reading materials](reading.md) from this module. 

Then you play out one of the following two situations:

1. A researcher comes to a supporter with their piece of software and asks for support on managing it.
2. A research supporter approaches a researcher who is, according to the organization's records, a contributor to the software.

Things for **the researcher** to be aware of and prepare before the conversation starts:

- What is the software about? Describe its purpose.
- Who will use it? 
- What is the expected lifecycle of the software?
- What potential users or applications are untapped?

Things for **the research supporter** to ask about and be able to give support on:

- Which FAIR principles are addressed?
- How can the software be made more FAIR?
- Is the software FOSS (Free and Open Source)?
- Is there an organization or person responsible for maintenance?
- What would be the next step (low-hanging fruit)?

Together:

- Define the next steps for the software


Goals:

- Frame an assessment positively: always start with assessing the things that have been done that contribute to good management and FAIR software. This is crucial, as well as motivating.
