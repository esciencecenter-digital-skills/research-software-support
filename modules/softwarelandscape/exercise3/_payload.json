Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2.
