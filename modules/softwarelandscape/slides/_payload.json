Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n\n",{"_path":866,"_dir":740,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":976,"description":1030,"order":716,"body":1031,"_type":731,"_id":1276,"_source":733,"_file":1277,"_extension":735,"plainText":1278},"These yellow pages are work in progress and will keep expanding.
