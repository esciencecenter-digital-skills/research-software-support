## Exercise: Study and present (20 - 30 minutes for 2-5 groups)

Pick a concept, initiative or organization from this module's [slide deck](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [yellow pages](/main/yellowpages) related to the Research Software Landscape (or find one you think should be there and while you are at it, [start a contribution](/main/contribute)). 

Then do a little research:

### Find out the following (10 minutes):

1. What kind of "thing" did you choose? (e.g. an organization, group of people, document, set of guidelines, etc.)
1. What is the core purpose or central thought behind your chosen concept?
1. Is your chosen concept globally active, bound to a country or somehow geographically located somewhere?
1. Describe the timeline of your chosen concept: any relevant history, its inception, any updates, is it still active?
1. How can the scientific community benefit from this concept?
1. Are there other concepts related to your chosen concept?
1. What else can you tell? Spicy details, fun facts? 

### Present (4 minutes):
With your group, present what you learned in 4 minutes of which you reserve one minute for questions.
