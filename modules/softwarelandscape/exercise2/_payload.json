It is used to process in-situ gamma-ray spectrometry measurements for luminescence dating.\n\n- gammaShiny has been deposited in the HAL French national archive and it has a persistent globally unique identifier, with the HAL identifier of the metadata record and a SWHID, identifying specifically the software artefact on the Software Heritage universal software source code archive.\n- Thanks to the HAL platform, where a licence is mandatory, gammaShiny is under a GNU General Public Licence v3.0.\n- The archived versions of gammaShiny’s source code in Software Heritage include a codemeta.json file, identifiable with a SWHID, where other metadata is available including dependencies named in CodeMeta (\"softwareRequirements\").\n\n## Do you agree?\n\nThe examples were taken from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x).\nIn the Results section of the paper you will find the authors' analysis of the software, which contains the statements above, mapped to the FAIR4RS Principles.\n\nDo you agree with their assessment?\n",[461,498,604,892],{"_path":462,"_dir":463,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":464,"description":7,"order":465,"body":466,"_type":453,"_id":494,"_source":455,"_file":495,"_stem":496,"_extension":458,"plainText":497},"/main/about","main","About",1,{"type":12,"children":467,"toc":490},[468,474,479,485],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":469,"children":471},{"id":470},"about-the-research-software-support",[472],{"type":25,"value":473},"About the Research Software Support",{"type":15,"tag":30,"props":475,"children":476},{},[477],{"type":25,"value":478},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.",{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":480,"children":482},{"id":481},"target-audience",[483],{"type":25,"value":484},"Target audience",{"type":15,"tag":30,"props":486,"children":487},{},[488],{"type":25,"value":489},"The target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":444,"depth":444,"links":491},[492,493],{"id":470,"depth":444,"text":473},{"id":481,"depth":444,"text":484},"local_fs:main:about.md","main/about.md","main/about","---\ntitle: About\norder: 1\n---\n\n## About the Research Software Support\nIn the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\n\n## Target audience\n\nThe target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"_path":499,"_dir":463,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":500,"description":7,"order":501,"body":502,"_type":453,"_id":600,"_source":455,"_file":601,"_stem":602,"_extension":458,"plainText":603},"/main/contribute","Contribute",4,{"type":12,"children":503,"toc":595},[504,510,515,521,526],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":505,"children":507},{"id":506},"contributing-to-the-research-software-support",[508],{"type":25,"value":509},"Contributing to the Research Software Support",{"type":15,"tag":30,"props":511,"children":512},{},[513],{"type":25,"value":514},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\nThis, as you can imagine, is no easy feat, and we need your help!\nSo first of all, thank you very much for your interest in contributing to this project.",{"type":15,"tag":238,"props":516,"children":518},{"id":517},"what-can-i-do",[519],{"type":25,"value":520},"What can I do?",{"type":15,"tag":30,"props":522,"children":523},{},[524],{"type":25,"value":525},"Go to our github repository by clicking on the GitHub logo in the top right of this website.",{"type":15,"tag":268,"props":527,"children":528},{},[529,543,566,578],{"type":15,"tag":272,"props":530,"children":531},{},[532,534,541],{"type":25,"value":533},"Contribute to the content discussion in the ",{"type":15,"tag":36,"props":535,"children":538},{"href":536,"rel":537},"https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/labels/module%20discussion",[262],[539],{"type":25,"value":540},"module issues",{"type":25,"value":542},", e.g. by listing good resources for information.",{"type":15,"tag":272,"props":544,"children":545},{},[546,548,555,557,564],{"type":25,"value":547},"Review a lesson module;
