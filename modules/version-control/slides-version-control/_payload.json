Because of this you can always \"play back\" to an earlier version or compare separate iterations, without having to store near-identical variations of the same documents.\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\"  -->\n## Software is...\n\n... a collection of one or more documents.\n\n- Code\n- Documentation\n- Environment & infrastructural files\n- ...\n\n\nnote:\nAny piece of code is nothing more than a (plain) text document, not too different from a Word file. The same is generally true for most other files comprising the software. Therefore, changes are excessively easy and computationally efficient to track.\n\nEven complex (binary, data, image, ...) files can ultimately be rendered in plain text, and therefore tracked using version control. Although changes are not easy to visualize and it will require multiplying the data storage for each change.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n## Changes...\n\n... are stored using a version control (VC) system (usually `git`).\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/git-diff.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\nA single unit of change is called a [commit](version_control_terminology), and is typically associated with a brief [commit message](version_control_terminology), [commit hash](version_control_terminology) (SHA), and other metadata.\n\u003C!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" -->\n\nnote:\nCommit hashes are unique references to a commit, while commit messages are human readable descriptions.

Balancing these factors helps maintain clarity and makes it easier to track, review, and revert changes when needed.\n\n==\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n## Sequential commits...\n\n... form a log\n\nThe data structure that contains the software plus the commit history is called a [repository](version_control_terminology).\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/git-log.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\nnote:\nA good rule of thumb for commit sizing is whether you can write a clear, concise commit message summarizing the change. If the commit is too small, the message will simply describe the specific action taken. If it's too large, summarizing it succinctly becomes difficult.
