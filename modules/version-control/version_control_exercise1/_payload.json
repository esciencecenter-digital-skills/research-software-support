Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2.
