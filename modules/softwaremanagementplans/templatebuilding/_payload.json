You can also use the physical space on your sheet of paper to group the various requirements together. \n\nFor this, use the following considerations (section 5 in [the guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7589725)):\n\n1. **Purpose**. What is the current reason or expected end-use for developing the software?\n2. **Reliability**. The effect of software failure and/or non-maintenance on:\n    - Risk of harm to self or others. This includes injury, privacy violation, bias, and inappropriate content.\n    - Reputation. For example to self, institution or other.\n    - Research, either your own or of others.

The long-term effort needed to maintain the software as long as it might be used as a standalone tool or dependency. This includes maintenance functions that can extend beyond the lifespan of the original development project and includes fixing bugs, dependency management, operating system compatibility, and security issues.\n\n\n## Step 3: Assess your template\n\n- Assess what level of management (low, medium, high) your custom template matches most. \n- What is different from your custom template and the default management level template? Does this difference make sense?\n- Finally use section 6 (Implementation Examples) from the [Practical Guide to Software Management Plans](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7589725) to create the Software Management Plan template with questions that a researcher/developer would have to answer. \n",[265,301,406,557],{"_path":266,"_dir":267,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":268,"description":7,"order":269,"body":270,"_type":258,"_id":298,"_source":260,"_file":299,"_extension":262,"plainText":300},"/main/about","main","About",1,{"type":13,"children":271,"toc":294},[272,278,283,289],{"type":16,"tag":34,"props":273,"children":275},{"id":274},"about-the-research-software-support",[276],{"type":22,"value":277},"About the Research Software Support",{"type":16,"tag":25,"props":279,"children":280},{},[281],{"type":22,"value":282},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.",{"type":16,"tag":34,"props":284,"children":286},{"id":285},"target-audience",[287],{"type":22,"value":288},"Target audience",{"type":16,"tag":25,"props":290,"children":291},{},[292],{"type":22,"value":293},"The target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":253,"depth":253,"links":295},[296,297],{"id":274,"depth":253,"text":277},{"id":285,"depth":253,"text":288},"local_fs:main:about.md","main/about.md","---\ntitle: About\norder: 1\n---\n\n## About the Research Software Support\nIn the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\n\n## Target audience\n\nThe target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"_path":302,"_dir":267,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":303,"description":7,"order":304,"body":305,"_type":258,"_id":403,"_source":260,"_file":404,"_extension":262,"plainText":405},"/main/contribute","Contribute",4,{"type":13,"children":306,"toc":398},[307,313,318,325,330],{"type":16,"tag":34,"props":308,"children":310},{"id":309},"contributing-to-the-research-software-support",[311],{"type":22,"value":312},"Contributing to the Research Software Support",{"type":16,"tag":25,"props":314,"children":315},{},[316],{"type":22,"value":317},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\nThis, as you can imagine, is no easy feat, and we need your help!\nSo first of all, thank you very much for your interest in contributing to this project.",{"type":16,"tag":319,"props":320,"children":322},"h3",{"id":321},"what-can-i-do",[323],{"type":22,"value":324},"What can I do?",{"type":16,"tag":25,"props":326,"children":327},{},[328],{"type":22,"value":329},"Go to our github repository by clicking on the GitHub logo in the top right of this website.",{"type":16,"tag":51,"props":331,"children":332},{},[333,347,369,381],{"type":16,"tag":55,"props":334,"children":335},{},[336,338,345],{"type":22,"value":337},"Contribute to the content discussion in the ",{"type":16,"tag":59,"props":339,"children":342},{"href":340,"rel":341},"https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/labels/module%20discussion",[63],[343],{"type":22,"value":344},"module issues",{"type":22,"value":346},", e.g. by listing good resources for information.",{"type":16,"tag":55,"props":348,"children":349},{},[350,352,359,361,368],{"type":22,"value":351},"Review a lesson module;

Find a piece of research software that you like (because of the topic or nice picture, or whetever other reason) from the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/software?page=1&rows=48).\n\n1. Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2.
