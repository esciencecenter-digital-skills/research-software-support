Find a piece of research software that you like (because of the topic or nice picture, or whetever other reason) from the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/software?page=1&rows=48).\n\n1. Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Explore software management plans fitting your piece of software by using the [Exploring the SMP Questionnaire](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/smp_questionnaire) exercise in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan and download the Word file.\n",{"_path":341,"_dir":212,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":593,"description":649,"order":350,"body":650,"_type":202,"_id":917,"_source":204,"_file":918,"_stem":919,"_extension":207,"plainText":920},"These yellow pages are work in progress and will keep expanding.
