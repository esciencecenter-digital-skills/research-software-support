## Exploring the SMP Questionnaire (15 minutes)

*In a live setting, this exercise is done in groups of three.
Each group will be assigned a software project.
The group will then explore the SMP questionnaire for this project.*

### Step 1: Choose a software project

Choose a software project for this exercise, preferably one you are familiar with.

If you don't have a project in mind, you can use one of the following:

- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [LitStudy](https://research-software-directory.org/software/litstudy)
- [Haddock](https://research-software-directory.org/software/haddock3)
- [WORCS](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html)
- [democracy-topic-modelling](https://research-software-directory.org/software/democracy-topic-modelling)

### Step 2: Explore the SMP Questionnaire

- Open the SMP questionnaire at [smp.research.software](https://smp.research.software)
- Fold out the "Scope" and "Software Management" tables of content (click on the triangle)
- Provide different answers for the "Scope" questions and observe which other "Scope", or "Software Management" items appear or vanish

The question categories are as follows:

DCCs provide a guidelines for each requirement in which cases it should or should not be included in the SMP. The SMP questionnaire makes an educated guess about this.

**Do you agree with the selection of criteria?**
