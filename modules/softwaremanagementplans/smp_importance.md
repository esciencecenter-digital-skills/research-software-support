title: Importance of SMPs
type: exercise
order: 2
---


## What's in it for me? Convince your colleague on why an SMP is important (10 minutes)

Pair up with **two** other participants and pick one of three roles.

<dl>
    <dt><b>1. Support staff</b></dt>
    <dd>Tries to explain the benefits of an SMP</dd>
    <dt><b>2. Researcher</b></dt>
    <dd>Indifferent about SMPs and very busy</dd>
    <dt><b>3. Moderator</b></dt>
    <dd>Checks if good arguments were used, suggests alternatives</dd>
</dl>

Pick a piece of software from the following examples:

- A software package you yourself have been involved in, if any.
- A Jupyter notebook to get the average length of everyone in this classroom.
- [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/), a state of the art modelling framework, used for research and forecasting in ocean and climate sciences.
- [worcs](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html), an RStudio project template to ensure a research project meets the requirements of Open Science.
- [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.com/), an AI system developed by Google DeepMind that predicts a proteinâ€™s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence.

Assume that the researcher is nudged by their supervisor to create an SMP. Find out in the discussion whether it's a good idea to create an SMP and what benefits it would bring. Also be open to the idea that creating an SMP might _not_ be applicable in the current state of the project.

**What arguments could you collect _in favor_ of SMPs?**

**What arguments _against_ its use?**

**Was the researcher convinced by the arguments?**
