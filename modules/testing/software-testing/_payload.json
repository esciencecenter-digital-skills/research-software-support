They help users easily verify that they have correctly installed your software, often providing examples of how to use it effectively.

They manage complexity by encouraging code that is easier to test, which in turn makes it easier to understand and maintain.\n\n### Types of Testing\n\nThere are several types of tests used in software development, each serving a specific purpose to ensure the quality and functionality of the software.\n\n- **Smoke Tests**: Also known as \"verification testing\", \"confidence testing\" or \"sanity testing\", smoke tests are a preliminary type of testing that checks the basic functionality of the software. They are often used to determine if a new build is stable enough to proceed with more detailed testing. Smoke tests quickly identify major issues that could prevent the software from functioning at a basic level.\n\n- **Unit Tests**: These tests focus on individual functions or components of the software, testing them one at a time.
