After every integration, a working version of the project is built and the software's test suite is run automatically, making it possible to identify defects, errors, flaws, or bugs introduced by changes early in the development process. This helps keep the code up-to-date and reduces the chances of major issues when combining everyone's work.\n\nContinuous deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying every working version of the project that passes the automated testing phase to its end-users.\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Take home messages\n\n- Automated software testing is key for quality, reliability, and reproducibility\n- Unit tests verify individual components, integration tests check component interactions\n- CI/CD streamlines development and enhances deployment efficiency\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n",[544,580,685,978],{"_path":545,"_dir":546,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":547,"description":7,"order":10,"body":548,"_type":536,"_id":576,"_source":538,"_file":577,"_stem":578,"_extension":541,"plainText":579},"/main/about","main","About",{"type":12,"children":549,"toc":572},[550,556,561,567],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":551,"children":553},{"id":552},"about-the-research-software-support",[554],{"type":21,"value":555},"About the Research Software Support",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":557,"children":558},{},[559],{"type":21,"value":560},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.",{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":562,"children":564},{"id":563},"target-audience",[565],{"type":21,"value":566},"Target audience",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":568,"children":569},{},[570],{"type":21,"value":571},"The target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":523,"depth":523,"links":573},[574,575],{"id":552,"depth":523,"text":555},{"id":563,"depth":523,"text":566},"local_fs:main:about.md","main/about.md","main/about","---\ntitle: About\norder: 1\n---\n\n## About the Research Software Support\nIn the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\n\n## Target audience\n\nThe target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.",{"_path":581,"_dir":546,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":582,"description":7,"order":583,"body":584,"_type":536,"_id":681,"_source":538,"_file":682,"_stem":683,"_extension":541,"plainText":684},"/main/contribute","Contribute",4,{"type":12,"children":585,"toc":676},[586,592,597,603,608],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":587,"children":589},{"id":588},"contributing-to-the-research-software-support",[590],{"type":21,"value":591},"Contributing to the Research Software Support",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":593,"children":594},{},[595],{"type":21,"value":596},"In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.\nThis, as you can imagine, is no easy feat, and we need your help!\nSo first of all, thank you very much for your interest in contributing to this project.",{"type":15,"tag":29,"props":598,"children":600},{"id":599},"what-can-i-do",[601],{"type":21,"value":602},"What can I do?",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":604,"children":605},{},[606],{"type":21,"value":607},"Go to our github repository by clicking on the GitHub logo in the top right of this website.",{"type":15,"tag":168,"props":609,"children":610},{},[611,625,647,659],{"type":15,"tag":172,"props":612,"children":613},{},[614,616,623],{"type":21,"value":615},"Contribute to the content discussion in the ",{"type":15,"tag":94,"props":617,"children":620},{"href":618,"rel":619},"https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/labels/module%20discussion",[98],[621],{"type":21,"value":622},"module issues",{"type":21,"value":624},", e.g. by listing good resources for information.",{"type":15,"tag":172,"props":626,"children":627},{},[628,630,637,639,646],{"type":21,"value":629},"Review a lesson module;
