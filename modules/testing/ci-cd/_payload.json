Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n",{"_path":260,"_dir":130,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":511,"description":567,"order":10,"body":568,"_type":120,"_id":826,"_source":122,"_file":827,"_stem":828,"_extension":125,"plainText":829},"These yellow pages are work in progress and will keep expanding.
