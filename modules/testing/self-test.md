## Question C: Which best describes Continuous Integration and its benefits for this project?

1. Continuous Integration is a practice where team members work in isolation to ensure their code is perfect before integrating it once at the end of the project, helping to avoid conflicts and errors.
2. Continuous Integration involves the use of specialized software to automatically translate code into multiple programming languages, making it more versatile and reducing workload.
3. Continuous Integration is a development practice where team members frequently integrate their work, often several times a day, to detect and fix integration issues early, thereby improving collaboration and code quality.
4. Continuous Integration is a method where team members manually review each other's code at the end of each day, ensuring that the code meets quality standards and is ready for client presentation.
5. Continuous Integration refers to the continuous updating of software to incorporate user feedback and new features, ensuring the software evolves to meet user needs.
