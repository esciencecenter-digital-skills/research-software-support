### What is software?

To non-programmers, software can appear to be a somewhat magical thing. It is in our computers and phones and it makes them work, or sometimes not work. It's made by specialist people who we call programmers, and who must be very smart to be able to make all this work, or perhaps very dumb given how often software doesn't work. In short, it seems to be mysterious.

Of course, programmers are perfectly ordinary people. They make the software that makes our phones and computers work, and sometimes programmers make mistakes, and then the software doesn't work as intended. Computer programs are made by typing text into the computer, just like you do when writing an email or a letter. Computer programs consist of one or more files with instructions for the computer. These files can be modified to change what the software does, they can be combined together into a larger, more complex program, and they can be shared with others and reused. For the computer to be able to run the software, the files need to be translated from the human-readable text form (the *source code*) into a sequence of numbers encoding the same commands (a *binary*). This is done mechanically by a special program called a compiler or an interpreter.

There are different ways of making software collaboratively. One is to work closely together (even sharing a computer!) on the same source code, which can help reduce mistakes as two see more than one, or it can be useful as a teaching exercise. Looser ways of collaborating include copying someone else's code and then independently modifying it to do something a bit different, and reusing a software component made by someone else in your own program, usually in its original form but possibly with changes as well.

The looser forms of collaboration rely on software being distributed from its maker to its user, who then modifies it or integrates it. This requires permission from the copyright owners because there's distribution and the creation of a derivative work, which means that there needs to be a license. A reliable and easy way to do this is to make all the software Free and Open Source.


#### Above from the licensing lesson, below is some additional text


The text that programmers type has to adhere to a specific set of rules that determine how the text should be written and what it then means. Such a set of rules is called a programming language, analogously to a human language which does the same. Programming languages are based on English, with some mathematics and computer architecture mixed in. They are designed for humans to use, and computers don't speak them. Therefore, software must be translated from the programming language it's written in into the binary code (ones and zeros) the computer hardware understands. So there are really two versions of each computer program, the *source code* for humans and a *binary* for the computer.

Software can be distributed either in the form of source code, or as a binary for a particular type of computer. The main difference is that source code is easy to read and modify, while a binary isn't. So if you want people to be able to understand how the software works, and/or modify it, then they need to get the source code, not (only) a binary.

The terminology around this can be a bit confusing, as there are many terms that are used to describe software. What is a program, a script, a package, a module, a library? There's no single definition that applies everywhere, but generally speaking a program is a software component that is intended for use by an end user rather than by other programmers. A script is a small program that is often only used by its author. A package, module or library is a collection of software components intended for use by other programmers in their packages, modules, libraries, scripts or programs.
