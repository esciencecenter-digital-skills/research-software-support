## Software is not data

Software is...

- **complex**: code is creatively generated, interconnected and multi-layered
- **interdependent**: it builds upon and therefore depends on other software
- **executable**: it is not static, but can be run
- **dynamic**: it can break over time, and versioning is common

Note:
While technically, software is a special kind of data (in that it is representation of information in a digital state), they are in essence quite different.

Software and data both are digital objects, sharing certain characteristics: they can be assigned a DOI, and they can have a license.

Software is quite different from data, however. Consider:

- Complexity; it is not a single file, but a collection of files that are interconnected and multi-layered, and do not necessarily stand on their own. Software is also the result of a creative process that provides a tool to do something, and not the result of a measurement or observation.
- Interdependence; software is often built using other software, and rarely built completely from scratch. This makes it dependent on other existing applications, which themselves may also change over time.
- Executability; software is in its dryest form a set of instructions that can be an archive of a procedure. However, the main goal of software is that these instructions can be executed. Data, by contrast, stand on their own.
- Dynamic vs static; its interdependence and context-dependency drives software to require maintenance to retain its value, and this maintenance is not straightforward. Maintenance is also counter to academic culture; it does not fit in existing structures (both in terms of reward/recognition, but also in terms of funding and understanding of what is needed). Versioning of software is very common, while data is often static (though versions may happen).

## Software opportunities

- Software is a **living thing**
- Creative process allows for **early adoption** of good practices
- Openness and transparency are **inherent** to software


Note:
The different nature of software also provides opportunities.
Software is a living thing, and therefore it is easier to adopt good practices early on.
Crucially, there is a community driven openness in software that long predates the open science movement.
This is not to say that software is inherently open, but that there is a broad open culture, which also comes with existing tools and pathways to facilitate openness and transparency.
Consider GitHub (and other code hosting platforms), which are designed for this purpose.
Consider also version control software, a good software development practice that builds in provenance.
