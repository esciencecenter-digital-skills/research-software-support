## Citing software

Software has become a crucial part of scientific research, yet it is not cited or credited as often and as easily as traditional research outputs. However, it is important to properly cite software, for many reasons, among which:

**Reproducibility**. Citing your software, like citing your sources, is a crucial step in allowing other researchers to reproduce your results. Accurate information about the software — and its version! — used in your research is necessary for others to obtain and use the same software, making it easier to validate and build upon your research.

**Recognition**. By citing software properly, researchers can give credit where credit is due, and ensure that the creators of the software are recognized for their contributions. Furthermore, citations can be tracked, which allows for more accurate assessment of the software's impact: who uses it, and what projects does it contribute to?

In this module, we will further illustrate the importance of software citation, and we will demonstrate how scientific software can be cited, and how to facilitate this as the author of scientific software. Here, you will be introduced to the file type `CITATION.cff`, which was developed especially for this purpose.

## The `CITATION.cff` file

To facilitate the citation of scientific software, a group of software developers, researchers, and publishers have come together to develop the `CITATION.cff` format. A `CITATION.cff` file is a lightweight, machine-readable file that provides information about the software, its creators, and how it should be cited. This file can be included in the software, and should be easy to find and access.

## Using cffinit to create `CITATION.cff`

This tutorial demonstrates the use of CFFinit, to create a `CITATION.cff` file. You can find the tool at [citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/).
