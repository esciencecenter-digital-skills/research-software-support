### The Turing Way (20 minutes)
Read in the Turing Way about [Software licenses](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-software.html) , as well as [Data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-data.html) and [Machine Learning Model licenses](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ml.html). It is good to realize that these are different in ways that are relevant for re-use, that need to be covered specifically in a license.

### License compatibility (20 minutes)
The Turing Way also discusses license compatibility. It is good to be aware of this issue. The example in The Turing Way is an excellent in-depth analysis, but for a first overview [this blog post on mend.io is a good start](https://www.mend.io/resources/blog/license-compatibility/).
