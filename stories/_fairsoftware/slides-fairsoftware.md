# FAIR software

## Inspiring introduction

Note:

Software plays an important role in science. A first thought may be its role in data collection and analysis. Further, it may play a role in designing experiments, based on models generated. It may _be_ the experiment itself, simulate a research outcome based on data or ideas entered; it may also be the "brain" behind controlling crucial instrumentation.

What scientific software can you think of?

What role does it play?

## The place of software in science

Note:

Open source software included in UNESCO recommendations on open science
Various studies highlight importance of research software, but attention for software management is still limited

## Research life cycle

Note:
Emphasize the role of software in all phases of research.

## FAIR

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable

Open Science principle, originally for data, but also applicable to software.

Note:
FAIR is not a perfect, but a useful metric.
It is a practical framework for thinking about software sustainability.
FAIR is not a checklist, but a set of principles; as such, it informs a spectrum of software sustainability, and not a binary "FAIR or not FAIR".

## Software sustainability

Note:
Software breaks over time. It needs to be maintained, updated, and adapted to new environments. This is called software sustainability.

## Goal: reproducible research

Note:
Is this actually the goal of research software? Or is it to make research more efficient, or to make it possible to do research that would otherwise be impossible?
Or all of the above?

## Software challenges

What challenges does software pose that data does not?

- Software is more complex: it is more difficult to understand
- Software is more dynamic: it can break over time
- Software is interdependent: it depends on other software
- Software is more diverse: many different types of software

Note:
Software requires maintenance to retain its value, and maintenance is not straightforward.
Maintenance is also counter to academic culture; it does not fit in existing structures (both in terms of reward/recognition, but also in terms of funding and understanding of what is needed).

## Manage your software

- Is there software we can already use/adapt?
- How easy is it for others to take and use?
- Who will use the software afterwards?
- How will they use it?
- NOT another bit of admin: software management leads to better science!

## Not all software is created equal

Note:
Research software comes in many shapes and sizes; can be single R package written by a PhD student to analyse data from a specific machine.
It can also be a multinational collaboration to develop a tool that is used by thousands of researchers worldwide.

Different software has different needs, but there are common principles in managing them and ensuring their sustainability.
Acknowledging that research software is a broad term and all research software benefits good management is an important first step.

## Take home messages

- Software is found in all stages of the research cycle
- Research software comes in many shapes and sizes
- Software sustainability is important but challenging to achieve
- Good software management leads to better science
- FAIR principles give a practical framework for tackling software sustainability
