## What is FAIR?

### FAIR principles

Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable

Read [this paper by Wilkinson et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)

### FAIR software

What is FAIR software?

Read [this paper by Lamprecht et al.](https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026) and [this paper by Barker et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x).

A bit of history: FAIR principles first, then application to software.
Principles were written for data, not software, but they can be useful and are powerful Open Science principles.

:::Chapter{headline="Exercise 1" widemd=1}

## Exercise: Where does software fit in the research life cycle?

Take a look at the research life cycle below.

Think of a piece of research software you have used or developed.

Where does it fit in the research life cycle?

### Existing software
The following research software can also be used:

- Xenon
- ESMValTool
- RS-Dat
- EUCP Atlas
- Haddock

## Five recommendations for FAIR software

### [Use a publicly accessible repository with version control](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/repository/)

- Create open online repository on GitHub
- Publish and version control your source code

### [Add a license](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/license)

- How do I choose a license?
- Online resources to help you choose a license
- Add license to your repository

### [Register your code in a community registry](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/registry)

- What is a software registry?
- Why is it important to register your software?
- How do you choose a registry?

### [Enable citation of the software](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/citation)

- What is software citation?
- Why is software citation important?
- How to tell users how to cite your software?
- What is DOI, CITATION.cff and CodeMeta?

### [Use a software quality checklist](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/checklist)

- What is a software quality checklist?
- Why should I use a cheklist?
- What are the checklists I can use?

## Exercise



[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x) mapped the principles to what they actually mean.

The exercise:

- We remove the explicit reference to the principle
- Participants map the stated reference to a principle.

:::Chapter{headline="FAIR vs FOSS" widemd=1}

From Lamprecht et al 2020:

Free and/or Open Source Software (FOSS). However, while there is a clear overlap between the objectives of FAIR and FOSS with regard to accessibility and reusability, they are not the same (see also [13]). FOSS is mostly concerned with source code being open and licensed under an open license. Open source and permissive licenses are desirable for FAIR software, but although FAIR has its roots in the “FOSS-loving” research software community, they are not a requirement as such. Indeed FAIR does not require data to be open, as clearly certain data sets (e.g., patients’ electronic health records, genomics sequences) require adequate access control (see go-fair FAQ [14]). However, such privacy and sensitivity concerns are not in the same way valid for research software that relates to published research, where there is an expectation that the methodology is made available. It remains to be discussed how open research software should be in order to meet the intentions behind FAIR.
