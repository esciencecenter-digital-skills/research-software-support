## What is FAIR?

### FAIR principles

Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable

Read [this paper by Wilkinson et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)

### FAIR software

What is FAIR software?

Read [this paper by Lamprecht et al.](https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026) and [this paper by Barker et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x).

A bit of history: FAIR principles first, then application to software.
Principles were written for data, not software, but they can be useful and are powerful Open Science principles.

- Publish and version control your source code

### [Add a license](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/license)

- How do I choose a license?
- Online resources to help you choose a license
- Add license to your repository

### [Register your code in a community registry](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/registry)

- What is a software registry?
- Why is it important to register your software?
- How do you choose a registry?

### [Enable citation of the software](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/citation)

- What is software citation?
- Why is software citation important?
- How to tell users how to cite your software?
- What is DOI, CITATION.cff and CodeMeta?

### [Use a software quality checklist](https://fair-software.eu/recommendations/checklist)

## Exercise



[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x) mapped the principles to what they actually mean.

The exercise:

- We remove the explicit reference to the principle
- Participants map the stated reference to a principle.
