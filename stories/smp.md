## Software Management Plans

Research software plays a crucial role in academic research and has become a key output of many research projects. A software management plan helps to implement best practices during software development and ensures that software is accessible and reusable in the short and longer term. It also contributes to the reproducibility of results and stimulates collaborative work on open-source software for research.

:::Chapter{headline="Why an SMP?" widemd=1}
Itâ€™s not hard!

A software management plan (SMP) can help to:

- Explain why developing new software is necessary
- Make the research software reusable and sustainable
- Plan for necessary resources
- Allow for verification of work that went into implementation

:::

:::Chapter{headline="Exercise" widemd=1}

1. Think of a software project
2. Go to: [tinyurl.com/SMP-guide](tinyurl.com/SMP-guide)
3. Select the core requirements (section 5) you think are relevant for this type of software
4. Create an SMP template by formulating question (examples: section 6)

Bonus: fill in the template for your chosen project

:::Chapter{headline="Exercise: SMPs in practice" widemd=1}

This exercise is done in pairs.

## Step 1: Familiarize yourself with the software

- Look at the software repository or page in the Research Software Directory
- Assess what level of management the software needs
-


Role playing exercise:
One person presents the software, the other person gives feedback.

Tasks for presenter:

- What is the software about?
- Who will use it?
- What is the expected lifecycle of the software?
- What potential users or applications are untapped?

Tasks for reviewer:

- Which FAIR principles are addressed?
- How can the software be made more FAIR?
- What would be the next step (low-hanging fruit)?

Together:

- Define the next steps for the software
-

Goals:

- Frame an assessment positively. Always start with assessing the things that have been done that contribute to good management and FAIR software. This is crucial, as well as motivating.

## SMP vs FAIR

### Why do we care?

When thinking of the importance of good software stewardship, management, and development practice, many reasons and motivations come to mind.
You may think of:

- Accuracy of results
- Reproducibility of results
- Reusability of software
- User friendliness of software
- Software quality
- Recognition and rewards for software developers
- Scholarly archive
- Software sustainability

What are the reasons and motivations that come to mind for you?

### Mapping motivations

(**NB:** If you are not yet familiar with the FAIR principles for research software, [take a look at the chapter on FAIR software](/fairsoftware) before doing the following exercise.)

The motivations we listed above were important considerations for the development of Software Management Plans as well as the FAIR principles for research software.
They do not match completely, however.
Each has its own focus and emphasis.

In the following exercise, we will map the motivations we listed above to the ultimate goals of SMPs and the FAIR principles.

Draw a Venn diagram with two circles: SMP and FAIR:

<img src="/stories/_smp/venn_fairsmp.png" width="400">

Map the motivations listed above to the Venn diagram.

- Which motivations are covered by SMPs, which by FAIR, and which by both?
- Do you find any motivations that are not covered by either?
- What does this tell you about the relationship between SMPs and FAIR?
