## Software Management Plans

Research software plays a crucial role in academic research and has become a key output of many research projects. A software management plan helps to implement best practices during software development and ensures that software is accessible and reusable in the short and longer term. It also contributes to the reproducibility of results and stimulates collaborative work on open-source software for research.

:::Chapter{headline="Why an SMP?" widemd=1}
Itâ€™s not hard!

A software management plan (SMP) can help to:

- Explain why developing new software is necessary
- Make the research software reusable and sustainable
- Plan for necessary resources
- Allow for verification of work that went into implementation

:::

:::Chapter{headline="Exercise" widemd=1}

1. Think of a software project
2. Go to: [tinyurl.com/SMP-guide](tinyurl.com/SMP-guide)
3. Select the core requirements (section 5) you think are relevant for this type of software
4. Create an SMP template by formulating question (examples: section 6)

Bonus: fill in the template for your chosen project

This exercise is done in pairs.

## Step 1: Familiarize yourself with the software

- Look at the software repository or page in the Research Software Directory
- Assess what level of management the software needs
-


Role playing exercise:
One person presents the software, the other person gives feedback.

Tasks for presenter:

- What is the software about?
- Who will use it?
- What is the expected lifecycle of the software?
- What potential users or applications are untapped?

Tasks for reviewer:

- Which FAIR principles are addressed?
- How can the software be made more FAIR?
- What would be the next step (low-hanging fruit)?

Together:

- Define the next steps for the software
-

Goals:

- Frame an assessment positively. Always start with assessing the things that have been done that contribute to good management and FAIR software. This is crucial, as well as motivating.
