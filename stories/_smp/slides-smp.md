## Software sustainability

Note:
Software breaks over time. It needs to be maintained, updated, and adapted to new environments. This is called software sustainability.

## Goal: reproducible research

Note:
Is this actually the goal of research software? Or is it to make research more efficient, or to make it possible to do research that would otherwise be impossible?
Or all of the above?

## Manage your software

- Is there software we can already use/adapt?
- How easy is it for others to take and use?
- Who will use the software afterwards?
- How will they use it?
- NOT another bit of admin: software management leads to better science!

## Not all software is created equal

A script to analyse


Note:
Research software comes in many shapes and sizes; can be single R package written by a PhD student to analyse data from a specific machine.
It can also be a multinational collaboration to develop a tool that is used by thousands of researchers worldwide.

Different software has different needs, but there are common principles in managing them and ensuring their sustainability.
Acknowledging that research software is a broad term and all research software benefits good management is an important first step.

From Lamprecht et al 2020: "Research software includes but is not limited to source code, binaries and web services, and covers a broad spectrum from short scripts written ad hoc by researchers to produce re- sults for a publication, to software rigorously developed for a mission-critical process"

- Software is found in all stages of the research cycle
- Research software comes in many shapes and sizes
- Software sustainability is important but challenging to achieve
- Good software management leads to better science
- FAIR principles give a practical framework for tackling software sustainability
