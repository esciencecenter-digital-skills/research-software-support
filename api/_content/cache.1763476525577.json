both by looking at [open PRs](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/pulls), as well as flagging issues for improvement in the [existing content](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/research-software-support/).\n- [Provide feedback](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/issues) on the different subjects covered: what did we miss? Should something be restructured?\n\n### How can I do it?\n\nIf you want to contribute to the content: look whether the issue you want to tackle [already exists](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/issues) or make a [new issue](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/issues/new), and [create a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your changes from a fork or a branch. \n\nIt is useful to take a look at [the NEBULA documentation](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs) and specifically review [the section on directory structure and content tags](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs/blob/main/module-dir-structure.md) before you start. \n\n## Target audience\n\nThe target audience for this material is University management and support staff.\nUniversity management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.\nThe University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.\n\nOn a practical level, this means that these modules do not need to be very technical.\nFor example, a module on version control does not need to explain the details of Git and the different commands.\nWhat it does need to do is explain why version control is important, and why it matters particularly in a research context.\nA participant should walk away with a more elaborate vocabulary around a subject, knowledge on where and how to find more information, and motivation that they could transfer to others.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nAs you are contributing to this material, please keep a few principles in mind:\n\n### The material should be broadly usable\n\nIt should be ready for teaching both online and offline; in a regular and a flipped classroom; and even for self study.\n\nThe modules in this repository will be used as lesson materials for a live audience, and provide a resource for self-study.\nEvery module should therefore contain some essential classroom elements (e.g. slides, group exercises), as well as exercises that can be done individually, and reference material that can be read at home.\n\n### The modules should be easy to (re)use\n\nIt is important that anybody can work with the material in this repository.\nSlides should therefore contain complete notes for an instructor, which can also be used in self-study.\nExercises should be clearly explained, and where possible, times should be given for different parts of the lesson so an instructor can plan a workshop around these materials.\n\n### Maintenance load should be kept to a minimum\n\nWe all know how fast things change, and how quickly information becomes outdated.\nIt is important to keep this in mind when creating lesson materials, and focus on core concepts, rather than specific tools and details.\nWhere it is useful to mention these, consider linking to external resources that will be maintained by others.\n\nIn general, it is better to link to external resources than to rewrite information that already exists elsewhere.\nThis, too, will limit the amount of maintenance that is required."},{"_path":"/","_dir":"","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Hello world","description":"Here is some

However, it is important to properly cite software, for many reasons, among which:\n\n**Understanding Research Fields**: Software is a product of research, and by not citing it, we leave holes in the record of research of progress in those fields.\n\n**Recognition**: Academic researchers at all levels, including students, postdocs, faculty, and staff, should be credited for the software products they develop and contribute to, particularly when those products enable or further research done by others. Non-academic researchers should also be credited for their software work, though the specific forms of credit are different than for academic researchers.

Additional information such as configurations and platform issues are also needed. Accurate information about the software — and its version! — used in your research is necessary for others to obtain and use the same software, making it easier to validate and build upon your research.\n\nIn this module, we will further illustrate the importance of software citation, and we will demonstrate how scientific software can be cited, and how to facilitate this as the author of scientific software.

This whole collection needs to be reproduced on the computer of the user for things to work. There are two ways of doing that: \n\n1) combining them all together on the computer of the developer, and then wrapping everything up into a package, installer, container image, or VM image that is sent to the user, or \n2) putting the components that you made yourself on the Internet (as a package), and relying on the user to download the other components (packages) and assembling it all together into a working application\n\n## Monolithic applications\n\nOption 1) works for applications, which are more or less independent. If they're used together, then it's by saving a file from one and opening it in another application. Each application contains all the bits it needs, and is installed on the user's computer in a separate folder, away from everything else. That means that different applications don't get in each other's way, but it's also rather inefficient if many applications use the same component, because you end up with many copies of that component.\n\nIf you do choose option 1), then you still have a choice between making a package, an installer, a container image, or a virtual machine image. A package is an archive (think a ZIP-file, which it often literally is) that contains, in this case, all the components needed by the application. Since it's just a file, a package needs to be installed by a special program called a package manager. The App Store or Play Store on your phone is such a program.\n\nAn installer is itself a computer program, that also contains all the components needed by the application. It gets downloaded by the user, who then runs it, after which it copies all the components from within itself onto the user's computer. It can then run there just like an application installed from a package using a package manager.\n\nA container image is a special kind of package. It also contains all the parts needed to run a program, but it is run in a special isolated environment called a container. A normal application can access everything else on the computer, including files and parts of other applications. It's set up to use its own components of course, but it could access other things if it wanted or needed to. An application that runs in a container can't do this, it's isolated from everything else except for the operating system. This is an advantage for example if the software runs on a server that is accessible from the Internet, because it provides some security. It also makes it easy to run many copies of the software on many servers, so that you can serve many users.\n\nA Virtual Machine finally is even more isolated. It contains its own operating system together with the application, so that the running application cannot even access the operating system on the user's computer. This has similar advantages as a container, being more secure, but it's also slower than using containers.\n\nSo these are the different ways option 1), distributing a monolithic application with everything included, can be implemented. As said, this reduces potential compatibility problems, but isn't very efficient because you end up with many copies of everything.\n\n## Separate packages\n\nOption 2) is more efficient than option 1), because the user can just install each component once, and then every other component that needs it can use it. There are drawbacks here as well though. First, the user needs to figure out which components are needed for a particular application, and then install them one by one. This puts them in an unpleasant place called \"dependency hell\".\n\nDependency hell was mostly solved by the invention of package managers, which automate the process of downloading and installing the required components. Example are pip, conda, apt, and Homebrew. If each component is put into a package with some metadata that describes which other packages it needs, then the package manager can do all that automatically, at least assuming that everything is Open Source and freely available online, because it cannot go to the shop to buy a license for everything. Still, often everything is Open Source and then this saves a huge amount of work. Dependency hell is not the only problem however.\n\nSoftware is continuously developed, and that means that it changes over time. Those changes sometimes change how a component is used by other components, which then need to be updated too. So the user may end up with an older program that only works with an older version of component X, while they also want to use a different newer program that works only with a newer version of X. A good package manager will give an error message in that case, but that doesn't solve the problem. Which version do you install?\n\nThere are again two common solutions to this, distributions and environments. A distribution, like Ubuntu, is made by a group of people who create a collection of packages that are all compatible with each other, meaning that every package in it that uses package X works with the same version of package X, namely the one that's included in the distribution.

Of course there are still updates, but they happen once every six months or several years, and then everything is updated at once. That does mean that you don't get the latest version right away, but also that things just work and don't suddenly break.

An environment is a separate part of the computer into which packages can be installed, in such a way that only packages within the environment are combined. So now you can install one application in one environment with one version of X, and the other application in another environment with another version of X. That costs more disk space, but it's easier to get the latest stuff, and it doesn't require all the work of constantly ensuring everything is compatible. So this makes option 2) look a bit more like option 1) again, although you can still have fewer environments than you have applications. (Bazaar!)\n\n## Which option to choose when\n\nScientific software is often a script, which is basically the topmost component in the whole collection of components. Scripts mostly just tell other components what to do. Since the script isn't used by other components, it can be packaged as an application in either of the above-mentioned ways. Users can then install and run it to *reproduce* the results, but not easily use it in their own script or modify it to do something different but related.\n\nSometimes, scientists (or Research Software Engineers!) develop components that are intended for use by others in their scripts, or even in other components. Those need to be packaged as packages for a package manager, because they need to be combined with other packages on the user's computer. (The user is a programmer, in this case!) This allows the software to be *reused* by others in their scripts.\n\nFinally, for others to be able to modify the software and perhaps contribute some new feature or fixes back to it, the source code of the software needs to be available through a public repository.

For reproducibility/transparency of research\n2. For developers that want to reuse parts of your software/methods\n3. For users that want to use your software\n\nnote:\nThere are many potential reasons for distributing your software. In science, these three\nscenarios are the most common. Note that users and developers can include yourself!\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Kinds of software\n\n\nScript, program, notebook, package, library, image, container, it's confusing!\n\nLet's clear that up first\n\nnote:\nSoftware can seem very confusing, because there are many different terms that are used\nto describe various kinds of software, and they're often used sloppily as well. So let's\nstart with explaining a bit how software is put together, and what all these terms mean.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Functions (or Procedures)\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n- Ordered list of instructions\n- Like a recipe\n- Can refer to other recipes\n- Closed box\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: right; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 70%; text-align: left\">\ndef minmax(list_of_things):\n    sorted_things = sorted(list_of_things)\n    smallest = sorted_things[0]\n    largest = sorted_things[-1]\n    return smallest, largest\n</pre>\n\n</div>\n\nnote:\nTo start, let's simplify everything way down and look at a basic component of software,\nthe function. (There's more to it, but this is all we need here and gives a good idea.)\nA function, or procedure which is really a better term but not what most people use\nanymore, is a list of instructions, like a recipe.\n\nTo make lasagna, you use sheets of dough, Béchamel sauce, and tomato sauce, and stack\nthem up in alternating layers before cooking everything in the oven. Of course tomato\nsauce does not grow on trees, so you'll need a sub-recipe to make that, and it's the\nsame with functions: they call other functions.\n\nLike with cooking, where you might get some ready-made pasta or sauce, the functions\ncalled from a function can be made by someone else. Your laptop has tens or hundreds of\nthousands of functions in it to do everything it does.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Scripts and Notebooks\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n- Single file with function(s)\n- Sit at the top of a pyramid\n- Use libraries\n- Run interactively\n- User handles errors\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 0%\">\n\n<img src=\"media/scripts_notebooks.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n</div>\n\n\nnote:\nA script is a small bit of software, usually a single file with one or a few functions\nin it. A notebook is a script that is run in a special environment, like Jupyter, which\nshows the script as a document with blocks of code and results (e.g. graphs) embedded in\nit.\n\nScripts and notebooks are run interactively by a user, who can see the code and handles\nany errors, if they occur. The functions called by the functions in a script are usually\nnot in the script itself, but come from libraries.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Libraries\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 5%\">\n\n- Lower levels of the pyramid\n- Ready-made functionality\n- Have an interface\n- Handle errors itself\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 0%\">\n\n<img src=\"media/scripts_notebooks.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n</div>\n\n\nnote:\nLibraries are collections of functions intended for use by others, either other\nlibraries, or scripts, or even people. They contain ready-made functionality organised\naround a topic. For example there are plotting libraries that can make different kinds\nof graphs, or libraries that can solve particular kinds of equations.\n\nLibraries have an interface or API, which consists of functions that the user is\nsupposed to call. The library will probably have some internal functions as well.\nLibraries need to handle any errors if they occur, either by working around the problem\nor by reporting it to the user in a well-defined way.\n\nDesigning APIs and handling errors is hard, so making a good library is not so easy, but\nlibraries are very reusable.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Programs\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n- At the top, or including all\n- Bigger than a script\n- End product, with user interface\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n<img src=\"media/programs.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n</div>\n\nnote:\nProgram is a very generic term. A script is a small program, and the borderline isn't\nvery clear. A program can do things on its own, so a library is not a program. Programs\noften include all the libraries that they use, but you can also say that program X\ndepends on library Y. A program is not meant for programmers, but for end users, with\nwhich it communicates through some kind of user interface, be it graphical or using text\nor on the command line.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Packages\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n- A file containing a collection of software\n- Intended for distribution\n- Usually holds a library or a program\n- Has metadata\n- Listed in a package index\n- Installed using a package manager\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 6%\">\n\n<img src=\"media/packages.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n</div>\n\n\nnote:\nPackages are often used to distribute software. A package is an archive file (e.g. a\nZIP file) that contains software, usually a library or a program. There is also metadata\nthat describes, among other things, licenses and authors and other packages containing software that is\nneeded by this one.\n\nPackages are usually uploaded to a package index, an online store of packages where\nusers can find them and download them, e.g. PyPI or CRAN. Finding, downloading and\ninstalling is done using a tool called a package manager, like pip or conda.\n\nEspecially older programming languages may not have a standard package index or package\nmanager, e.g. C++ and Fortran.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Images and containers\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n- A file containing a collection of software\n- Everything, including the OS\n- Cannot be combined\n- Can be run like a program, as a container\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 3%\">\n\n<img src=\"media/images_containers.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n</div>\n\nnote:\nA virtual machine image or container image is a file containing a collection of\nsoftware, like a package. However, an image contains absolutely everything needed,\nincluding (most of) the operating system. If you have an image, then you can run the\nprogram inside it on your computer. This will create a kind of virtual computer inside\nyour computer (that's called a Virtual Machine or a Container) inside which the software\nruns. Containers cannot be combined and you can't call them from a script, so they're\nonly useful for programs, not for libraries, and the user needs special software to be\nable to run the program.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Scenario 1: Review & reproduce\n\n- You have a script\n- The script uses some libraries\n- You want others to see and run it\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Distributing scripts/notebooks\n\n- Make script/notebook available for download\n- Make environment file, e.g. requirements.txt, environment.yml\n- User uses a package manager to create environment\n- User runs the script/notebook\n- Optional: use an image (mostly long-term archival)\n\nnote:\nIn this case, you have a script or a notebook, and also an environment (e.g. using Conda\nor virtualenv) with the libraries you use installed in it. This environment is really\njust a folder on your computer with the libraries in it, and some machinery that makes\nit so that when the script calls a function that is in a library, the library will be\nfound and the function run.\n\nSo, you need to share your script or notebook of course, but the user will also need a\nsimilar environment to run it, otherwise those library functions are missing. You can\n(and should!) facilitate that by making an environment file that describes all the\npackages containing the libraries that you're using. If you then make that available,\nthe user can create a similar environment on their computer and run your script.\n\nSoftware that manages these environments, like Conda and pip/virtualenv, can make these\nenvironment files for you, and also read one and create an environment by downloading\nall the needed packages from the Internet, so this is not too difficult.\n\nAnother option is to use an image, but 1) they're very big, 2) they require special\nsoftware, and 3) they're much more work to create. They do have the advantage that they\nwork without an Internet, or in the future when all that old stuff is no longer online.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Scenario 2: A reusable method\n\n- You have created a new method\n- Should be somewhat generic\n- To be used by programmers\n- Needs a library!\n\nnote:\nScientists sometimes develop new methods for calculating something, for example\nacoustics in a room. They will likely have a script that calculates things for their\npaper, and that script can be shared as in Scenario 1, but it would also be nice if\npeople could use their method for calculating acoustics in all sorts of scenarios, in\ncombination with other calculations.\n\nIn this case, what's really needed is a library. As mentioned before, making libraries\nisn't that easy, so they may need some help from a Research Software Engineer to design\na good interface. Another option, and often a better one actually, is to contribute to\nan existing widely used library. That will give your code more exposure, and may get you\nsome help from its maintainers as well, in the form of reviews.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Distributing libraries\n\n- Make a package containing the library\n- Add metadata with dependencies\n- Upload the package to a repository\n\nnote:\nThe best way to distribute a library is by making a package for it, if there is a\nsuitable packaging system available. Most modern programming languages have one, e.g.\nPyPI and pip for Python, or CRAN and install.packages() for R, or Cargo for Rust.\n\nSo your steps here are to find the right packaging system based on the programming\nlanguage the library is written in, then creating a package for that system (there is\nusually a manual/tutorial available), and uploading the package to the repository so\nthat users can use their package manager to install it. Make sure to list all the\ndependencies in the metadata!\n\nFor languages like Fortran or C++ that don't have a standard package manager, you could\ntry Conda, or make packages for an operating system-specific packaging system like\nAPT/DPKG (Debian/Ubuntu Linux), DNF/RPM (Red Hat Linux), HomeBrew or macPorts (macOS) or\neven EasyBuild, Spack or Nix (on High-Performance Computing)\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Scenario 3: A whole application\n\n- Not so common in science\n- You have created a program\n- To be used by end users\n\nnote:\nScientists don't often make whole applications with user interfaces that anyone can just\npick up and use. That's a lot of work, and you don't get credit for it in science.\nNevertheless there are examples of this, e.g. MaxEnt in ecology, and it could happen. In\nthis case, what you have is a program.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Distributing programs\n\n- In an app store!\n- As an installer?\n- As a package?\n- As an image?\n\nnote:\nThere are a few options for distributing a program. Packaging systems can be used,\nespecially if the program is intended for use by programmers, or by more knowledgeable\nusers. An App Store is basically a packaging system for applications, and that would be\na good option too if available.\n\nAnother option is to make an installer. That's a single file that is a working program,\nlike a package, but it is also itself a program that when run will install your program\nonto the user's system. If you've installed software on Windows then you may have seen\none, although they've mostly been replaced by app stores and may cause the operating\nsystem to warn about suspicious software.\n\nFinally, you could make an image here, but as before, it would be very large, and it\nwould require special software on the user's computer, so in the here and now it's not a\ngood option. It would be more resistant to changes in the operating system that break\nthe program, because it includes the old version of the operating system. And then\nagain, running an old operating system is a security risk.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Updating software\n\n- Can't we just put it online and be done?\n- For scripts, you probably can\n- Libraries and programs need maintenance\n\n\nnote:\nScripts are built on top of libraries, which sit on top of an operating system, which\nsits on top of hardware, and all that stuff is constantly changing. Furthermore, people change and expect to use software in different ways over\ntime, and that also needs to be taken into account.\n\nFor example, the LimePy library in the AMUSE astrophysics software uses a function in\nthe SciPy library that does not exist anymore. The old version of SciPy it was written\nfor was designed for an old version of Python, which is no longer supported and\nshouldn't be used anymore, for security reasons. Also, a script using LimePy may use\nother libraries that require a newer SciPy, and you can't install multiple versions of\nthe same thing at the same time, so you won't be able to run that script anymore.\n\nBecause of this, all software needs to be updated from time to time in order to continue\nto work. This is tricky in science, which works in terms of projects that are finished\nand then replaced by something else. For scripts, it's probably not so important because\npeople can still read the script to see what you did, and update it if they see the\nneed.\n\nFor libraries and programs, it's a different story, because those are used over a longer\nperiod, and for libraries other things get built on top of them, and we'd like all that\nto continue to work.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Versioning\n\n- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for libraries (X.Y.Z)\n- Less important for applications\n\nnote:\nFor libraries, it's important that you communicate about changes with programmers using\nyour library. If the changes affect your interface, then they will have to modify their\nsoftware to work with your new version. This is sometimes necessary and sometimes a good\nidea, as long as it doesn't happen too often. You do need to communicate it clearly\nhowever.\n\nA good way to do that is to use Semantic Versioning. This uses X.Y.Z versions, and from\nversion 1.0.0 promises that everything built on top of the library will continue to work\nas long as the first number remains the same. The second number is changed to mark\nadding new functions, and the third number is incremented if the new version only fixes\nbugs.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Summary\n\n- Script/notebook: publish with environment\n- Library: package and upload\n- Program: app store, package, installer\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\n[www.esciencecenter.nl](https://www.esciencecenter.nl)\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/documentation/ex_suitability","_dir":"documentation","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Suitable documentation","description":"As a group, consider the project that you worked on for your homework assignment.","type":"exercise","order":4,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"what-is-suitable-documentation-for-your-project"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is suitable documentation for \"your\" project?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As a group, consider the project that you worked on for your homework assignment."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"types-of-documentation"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Type(s) of documentation"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Which type of of documentation currently exists?

As we have seen however, that's not all you need to do. Because of copyright law, the software also needs a license. Sharing scientific software is sometimes simple from a legal perspective, but it can also be quite complicated. This section explains the main issues to take into account, which are ownership of the copyright, constraints imposed by dependencies, and choosing a license.\n\n### Ownership\n\nA copyright license must be given by the owner(s) of the copyright being licensed. This means that the first step to licensing a program is to find those owners. In most countries, including The Netherlands, any work you do as part of your tasks as an employee of an organisation belongs to your employer, not to you. After all, they're paying you to do the work. This means that the copyright on any software written by a university employee is owned by the university.\n\nIf the software to be shared is written entirely by one person, with no copy-pasting of code from others, and no help from people outside of the organisation, then the copyright is therefore owned by your organisation, and it can decide how to license the code.\n\nScience is often done collaboratively though, and that makes things a bit more complicated. Funding for research is often given to consortia comprising multiple organisations that will collaboratively execute the research project. Such a consortium is governed by a Consortium Agreement (CA), which almost always has an Intellectual Property paragraph. Unfortunately, the standard text in the templates used for those documents rarely mentions software, as it mainly addresses patents and trade secrets. It does however usually say that each party gets to own the things they make, and that the partners can use it for the purpose of executing the research, but not beyond that. (Note that there is always some negotiation regarding the text, so you should check any specific CAs that apply, and not rely on this general description.)\n\nFunding may also come with terms covering ownership. eScience Center grants for example come with a stipulation that both parties co-own the software even if it is written completely by one of the partners.\n\nSo, if your researcher works on the software together with a researcher from a different organisation, then both organisations need to agree to license their respective copyrights, ideally under the same license to avoid complicating things.\n\nFor long-lived scientific software that isn't Open Source already, it can sometimes be very difficult to determine ownership. It may not always be clear who wrote which part of the code (especially if no version control software was used), who they worked for when they did so, and which contracts were in place that governed their activities. Ideally, the copyright owners would have been carefully tracked over the life of the software, with copyright statements in the README documenting the owners. That is unfortunately very rare however. If it is not possible to determine the owners of the copyright, then the software cannot be licensed.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nOwners may not be completely free to decide how to license their software. Aside from any constraints imposed by funders, *dependencies* play a role. Dependencies are externally developed, separate software packages that are needed for the software to work. Having such dependencies is very common, and dependencies typically have their own dependencies, so that any complete computer program consists of a whole collection of software packages, usually written by different people. These days at least for Open Source software, the complete program is rarely distributed as a whole. Instead, the owners of the individual components each put their components online, and a special tool is used to collect all the required bits and combine them together on the computer of the user, who can then use the software.\n\nAs described in the section on licensing, strong copyleft licenses place constraints on how the combined software can be licensed. As a result, you cannot use them in a non-Open Source program. This does not mean that you have to make your software Open Source if has a copyleft dependency, but *if* you distribute it, then that must be done under the same license, and/or a more permissive one that does not conflict with it.\n\nAs you can see, dependencies with strong copyleft licenses can make life a bit more complicated. On the other hand, as long as no proprietary software is involved not much can go wrong. In case there are proprietary dependencies (including ones without a license, or \"academic use only\" or somesuch), there is a larger issue. If the software cannot work without the dependency, and the proprietary license does not allow redistribution, there we can still open source the software, but others won't be able to run it unless they can somehow get a copy of the proprietary dependency. And if you choose a strong copyleft license for your code, then you'll have to add a special exception for your users to be able to use it with the proprietary dependency.\n\nSo it is really proprietary software that complicates things legally, and that's aside from the lack of Open Science transparency. On the other hand, some proprietary software package is sometimes the only solution, and so proprietary dependencies cannot always be avoided. If that's the case, you'll have to look at the specific terms for that package and try to find a solution.\n\nWeak copyleft licenses are less of an issue, because they do not reach beyond the licensed package itself. They can become an issue if your researcher has copy-pasted code from them into their own program (which is bad practice, but unfortunately fairly common still), or created a modified version. In that case the same weak copyleft license applies to (parts of) their code or the modified software, thus restricting the available license choices.\n\n### Choosing a license\n\nIn almost all cases, scientific software should be licensed under a common, standard Open Source license. Open Source enables scientific collaboration and makes the work available to the society that paid for its creation, and not using a standard license creates enough legal risk that most potential users will not be willing to touch the software unless they really have to.\n\nWhether to use a permissive, weak, or strong copyleft license is up to the copyright owner. If your organisation has a policy on software, then it may well say something about which licenses can be used, so be sure to check that. The authors of the software may also have an opinion, or develop one if you explain the different kinds of licenses to them. A tool like [ChooseALicense](https://www.choosealicense.com) may help here.\n\nNote that Creative Commons licenses should not be used for software. They were created specifically to be able to apply the concept of Open Source to everything that is *not* software, and aren't suitable to the specific properties of software. So use CC for data and other works, and an Open Source license for software.\n\n"},{"_path":"/modules/licenses","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Licenses","description":"thumbnail-licenses","category":"Sharing Software","order":1,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":"What are software licenses, copyright and open-source, how are they related and why is it important to think about?","thumbnail":"thumbnail-licenses.png","visibility":"visible","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://unsplash.com/photos/laptop-compute-displaying-command-prompt-vII7qKAk-9A?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"thumbnail-licenses"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Photo by "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://unsplash.com/@disruptxn?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Desola Lanre-Ologun"}]},{"type":"text","value":" on "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://unsplash.com/photos/laptop-compute-displaying-command-prompt-vII7qKAk-9A?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Unsplash"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:licenses:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/licenses/index.md","_stem":"modules/licenses/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Software Licenses\ncategory: Sharing Software\norder: 1\nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: What are software licenses, copyright and open-source, how are they related and why is it important to think about?\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-licenses.png\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n[thumbnail-licenses](https://unsplash.com/photos/laptop-compute-displaying-command-prompt-vII7qKAk-9A?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@disruptxn?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Desola Lanre-Ologun</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/laptop-compute-displaying-command-prompt-vII7qKAk-9A?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>\n\n"},{"_path":"/modules/licenses/info","_dir":"licenses","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Learning objectives","description":"In this module you will learn to answer the following questions:","type":"info","order":0,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In this module you will learn to answer the following questions:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is a software license?

They want a product, which will be produced commercially, and that is a good match for the Open Source and permissive licensing model.\n\n"},{"_path":"/modules/licenses/slides","_dir":"licenses","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Licensing","description":"===","type":"slides","order":1,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"software-licensing"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Software Licensing"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"==="}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"common-questions"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Common questions"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Can I use this software I found online?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Can I share my software with others?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Can I contribute to someone else's software?"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Note:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are three different things researchers do with software that are affected by licensing: using someone else's software, sharing your own software, and contributing to someone else's software (or having others contribute to yours)."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You're probably most likely to get questions on the second topic, because the first is so commonly done that people either know the answer or don't know that it's even an issue, while the third one is still pretty rare in practice."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Software is covered by copyright, and that's the main legal context in which we'll look at these questions here."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"==="}]},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"style":"width: 70%; float: left; margin-top: 10%"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"about-copyright"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"About copyright"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Berne convention on copyright"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Owned by author or employer?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Can be licensed"}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"style":"width: 30%; float: right"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"src":"/modules/licenses/media/Zytgloggeturm_Bern.jpg","width":"100%"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"style":"float: left; clear: both; padding-left: 25%; padding-top: 1em"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"small","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Photo by "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:JoachimKohler-HB","title":"User:JoachimKohler-HB"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"JoachimKohler-HB"}]},{"type":"text","value":" - "},{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["int-own-work"],"lang":"en"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Own work"}]},{"type":"text","value":", "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0","title":"Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"CC BY-SA 4.0"}]},{"type":"text","value":", "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=140063312"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Link"}]}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Note:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"By the Berne convention, software is automatically protected by copyright when it is made.

Depending on the country, protection lasts 50 years or more. The owner of the copyright is the only one who can copy, publish, and modify the software.\n\nIf you make software as part of a job for an employer, then your employer owns the copyright. Otherwise, you are the owner (unless there's a contract somewhere that says otherwise).\n\nThe owner of the copyright on a work can give permission to others to do things they would otherwise not be allowed to do, like copying, publishing and modifying the work. A document that describes what they can do is called a copyright license. These licenses can be given to a specific party, usually as part of a contract, or they can be offered to the general public.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Using others' software\n\n- Two ways of using software\n- You need a license\n- Licenses sometimes implicit, or home-made\n- Open Source is better and safer\n- Different Open Source licenses available\n\n\nNote:\n\nThere are two ways of using someone else's software: running it, and incorporating it into your own program. Both are covered by copyright, because you need to download and because you're making a derivative work.\n\nSo you need copyright permission, which is to say a license. In science, these are sometimes implied, by a researcher publishing the code without an explicit license, or home-made, which is not recommended because a non-expert will overlook many of the details of copyright law.\n\nIt's better if the software has an Open Source license, because these are professionally written and have standard, well-known meanings. We will go into that a bit more later. There are websites available that explain all the standard Open Source licenses in ordinary language, so that you can easily decide whether you can use a certain software package. You don't need to be (or have) a lawyer to use Open Source software.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left\">\n\n## Why share software?\n\n- Reproducibility\n- Increasing impact\n- Academic freedom of employees\n- Saving by collaborating\n- Public funding\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: right\">\n<img src=\"media/Stephanie_Morales_Sharing.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; clear: both; padding-left: 35%; padding-top: 3em\">\n<small>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@stephaniemoarr?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Stephanie Morales</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-white-ceramic-mug-DGt9zA3Fr0g?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></small>\n</div>\n\n\nNote:\n\nScientific software is sometimes shared, but also sometimes kept to themselves by the researchers making it. Here are some reasons that sharing scientific software is important:\n\n- Software is a scientific method, and it must be shared for the science to be reproducible.\n- Sharing software will bring users of the methods and citations to papers about it\n- Researchers frequently change jobs, moving from university to university. Without permission from their previous employers, they would have to start rebuilding their software from scratch every time they move to a new university, which would be very inefficient.\n- Many of the most pressing problems that scientist work on involve complex, multifaceted systems that can only be properly studied in collaboration. Where software is involved, which is to say almost everywhere in academic research, researchers need to be able to exchange software and collaborate on its development, including across projects.\n- The software was most likely funded with public money, and should therefore be available to the public, just like papers are published Open Access.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left\">\n\n## How to share software\n\n- Put it online\n- Add a license\n    1.

This may be very simple but it can also be very complex. More on the next slide.\n\nThe next thing to consider is whether other software has been used in the software you've made (that's almost always the case) and how those so-called dependencies are licensed, as this may constrain your choice.\n\nFinally, different Open Source licenses specify different terms and conditions for use, and you need to decide what you want there.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Who owns a work?\n\n- Work for hire\n- Consortium agreements\n- Funding constraints\n\n\nNote:\n\nIn most countries, including The Netherlands, any work you do as part of your tasks as an employee of an organisation belongs to your employer, not to you. After all, they're paying you to do the work. This means that the copyright on any software written by a university employee is owned by the university.\n\nScience is often done in consortia, which are typically governed by a Consortium Agreement. Those often have a section on Intellectual Property that applies. Sadly those sections often don't mention copyright, but they do usually state that each partner gets to own the things they've made. That means that if your researcher has worked together on the software with researcher at one of the partners, that there are two owners that need to decide on licensing together.\n\nFunding may also come with restrictions or stipulations regarding ownership. For example, eScience Center grants come with a rule that says that both parties co-own the software, even if it was written by one of them, and that it will be published under the Apache License unless otherwise agreed.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Kinds of licenses\n\n<table style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\">\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n        <th colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Free and Open Source</th>\n        <th rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Proprietary</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n        <th colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Copyleft</th>\n        <th rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Permissive</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n        <th align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Strong</th>\n        <th align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Weak</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n      <td align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; padding: 1em\">GPL<sup>1</sup> AGPL<sup>2</sup></td>\n      <td align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; padding: 1em\">LGPL<sup>3</sup> MPL<sup>4</sup></td>\n      <td align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; padding: 1em\">BSD<sup>5</sup> MIT<sup>6</sup> Apache</td>\n          <td align=\"center\" >Research only, No&nbsp;copying, No&nbsp;modification</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 1em; font-size: 70%; line-height: 2em\">\n  <sup>1</sup>GPL: GNU General Public License <sup>2</sup>AGPL: Affero General Public License <sup>3</sup>LGPL: GNU Lesser General Public License <sup>4</sup>MPL: Mozilla Public License <sup>5</sup>BSD: Berkeley Software Distribution <sup>6</sup>MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n</div>\n\n\nNote:\n\nSoftware licenses can be classified into different categories, which is helpful to get a quick idea for what kind of license you are dealing with. First, there are Open Source and non-Open Source licenses. Open Source licenses allow you to use the software, share it, change it, and share your changes. Proprietary software licenses do not allow one or more of these things. Note that this is not about being commercial, you can actually sell copies of Open Source programs, although you're not very likely to find buyers.\n\nCopyleft licenses say that if you modify the licensed software or incorporate it into your own, that that new software package must then be licensed under the same license. A permissive license allows licensing the new work under any license. As a result, copyleft software needs to remain open source, while permissively licensed software can be made proprietary.\n\nWithin the copyleft licenses we can distinguish strong copyleft, which covers both modified versions and use in other programs, from weak copyleft, which only limits modification. So a weak copyleft license keeps the licensed software package itself Open Source, but can be used as a part of proprietary software, while a strong copyleft license keeps the software from being used in (but not with) proprietary software (it is a bit vague legally where the limit is).\n\nFinally, the Affero GPL is designed for use with software that is designed to be installed on a server and accessed remotely, for example through a web browser. A normal copyleft license does not require the server owner to give a copy of the software running on the server to the users, while the AGPL does.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Choosing a license\n\n- Use a standard Open Source license\n- Check your policy (if applicable)\n- Use a tool\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe next step is to choose a license. If at all possible, use a standard Open Source license, because it will make everyone's lives much easier. Do not use Creative Commons licenses, as they're not designed for use with software.\n\nNext, check if your organisation has a policy that covers software licenses. Those are still a bit rare, but they're being worked on in many places so it's likely that you'll have one at some point. Check whether it specifies a particular license, or maybe a range of acceptable ones.\n\nFinally, there are some nice tools available that make it easier to select an Open Source license. We'll have a look at that in the exercise.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left\">\n\n## Contributing to software\n\n- Under the license\n- Contributor License Agreements\n    - Who are you dealing with?\n    - Transfer or license?\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right\">\n<img src=\"media/Kleine_Dinge.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; clear: both; padding-left: 35%; padding-top: 3em\">\n<small>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markkoenig?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Mark König</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-green-quote-board-xCEuxxhpY3o?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></small>\n</div>\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe most common way of contributing to an open source project is to do it under the license associated with the project. That means that you keep the copyright on your addition or modification, and license it under the same license as the existing code. This is the norm for small projects run by volunteers (or scientists). This case is similar to sharing your own code under a given license.\n\nLarger, more professionally run Open Source projects sometimes require a Contributor License Agreement. This is a contract that states what the recipient of your improvement can do with it. These are not standardised, so the contents vary.\n\nWhen evaluating these, it's good to look at who you're dealing with. A commercial entity, like Google, or a governance organisation like the Apache Foundation. The latter non-profit offers support for Open Source projects, including making sure that everything is properly licensed. Google is of course a commercial entity.\n\nSome CLAs require you to transfer ownership of the copyright on your contribution to someone else, which can be a good idea if that sole copyright holder can be trusted, for example because it makes it easier to upgrade the license. It may also allow them to turn your work proprietary however. In other cases, you're just giving explicit permission to distribute your contribution as Open Source software, which seems more just.\n\nIn general with CLAs, you should be careful with commercial entities (state aid!), and it's in any case probably wise to get your legal department involved.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\n[www.esciencecenter.nl](https://www.esciencecenter.nl)\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/licenses/university_policy","_dir":"licenses","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software policies","description":"","type":"reading","order":7,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"university-software-policies-2-minutes"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"University software policies (2 minutes)"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Universities employ researchers, who often create and use software in the course of doing research.

You might run into projects using other repositories. \n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Tag/semantic versioning\n\nIt is important to communicate the actual version of the software used for a particular piece of research\n\nIf your software is used as a dependency of another software/workflow then specific versions can be referenced\n\nIdeally, use \"semantic versioning\" in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. v2.1.5)\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Get a Persistent Identifier\n\nSpecific versions of the software should be published to an archiving service that provides persistent identifiers.\n\nFor example, Zenodo is a long term archiving service for scientific data and software.\nZenodo will assign a **D**igital **O**bject **I**dentifyer (**DOI**) to the published data, making it citable.\n\nNote:\n\nSee Citation story\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Registries\nAdd a link to your software on a relevant public registry\n\n* For example, the eScience Center maintains the Research Software Directory\n* Can also be domain specific software registries\n* Or even list it on awesomelist\n\nThis aids greatly in Findability by relevant researchers\n\nNote:\nAn \"awesome list\" is a list of awesome things curated by the community, often hosted as a repository on GitHub.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### The Research Software Directory\n<style>\n.container{\n  display: flex;\n  text-align: start;\n}\n.col{\n  flex: 1;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n<div class=\"col\">\n<img src=\"media/rsd-front-page.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the front page of the RSD\">\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"col\" style=\"font-size: x-large\">\nThe Research Software Directory is an online service designed to <b>collect</b> and <b>present</b> “related research information” in a structured way.

It may _be_ the experiment itself, simulate a research outcome based on data or ideas entered; it may also be the \"brain\" behind controlling crucial instrumentation.\n\nWhat scientific software can you think of?\n\nWhat role does it play?\n\nAn example here: the Event Horizon Telescope, which took a \"picture\" of a black hole.\nThe \"telescope\" is not a single tool, but complex: a \"planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes\" (wikipedia).\nThe separate telescopes collect data that is synchronized with atomic clocks, and the data is combined at highly specialised supercomputers.\nThe data can be converted into an image using custom software.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Why Treat Research Software Differently?\n\nDefining Research Software...\n\n- Acknowledges its importance during research\n- Designates it as research output\n- Enables proper attribution\n- Facilitates findability and reusability\n\nNote:\n\nBy defining research software:\n\n- we can more easily justify and emphasize how essential it is while doing research\n- we can emphasize that creating (good) research software is an essential part of research and that the product is a true \"deliverable\" e.g. in grant applications\n- we give the opportunity for the developers to gain (citable) recognition for their work\n- by tagging software as \"research software\", we make it more (computer) findable, and therefor more easily reused\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## How Important is the Distinction?\n\n- It's not a dogma\n- No need to attach exact labels for any given software, instead ...\n- ... reflect on which software deserves special treatment\n\nNote:\n\nThe definitions are not always clear, and that's ok.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### What is Research Software?\n\n<img src=\"media/definition.png\" width=\"50%\">\n\n<small>definition of Research Software from the FAIR4RS working group</small>\n\nNote:\n\nA definition of research software, from the FAIR4RS working group.\nIt is important that not all software that is used in research is research software.\nFor example, a text editor that is used to write a paper is not research software.\nNor is PowerPoint, a web browser, or the software used to guide the telescope.\nEven tools like R or Python are not necessarily research software.\nThe code written in R or Python for an analysis would be research software, however.\nJust like a custom-made Excel macro that is used to analyse data.\nOr a custom-made web application that is used to collect data.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## The research lifecycle\n\nIn which stages is ***Research Software*** used?\n\n<img src=\"media/researchcycle.png\" alt=\"The Research Life Cycle\" width=\"55%\"/>\n\n\nNote:\n\nResearch Software is *mainly* used in \"Collecting\" and \"Processing & analyzing\" steps. \nHowever, non-research software can also be used in these steps, and research software can also be used in other steps.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## The research lifecycle\n\nIn which stages is ***Research Software*** used?\n\n<img src=\"media/research-cycle-RS.png\" alt=\"The Research Life Cycle\" width=\"55%\"/>\n\n\nNote:\n\nResearch Software is *mainly* used in \"Collecting\" and \"Processing & analyzing\" steps. \nHowever, non-research software can also be used in these steps, and research software can also be used in other steps.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Take home messages\n\n- Software is an important part of research\n- Not all software used in research is Research Software\n- Defining \"Research Software\" provides recognition in the research community\n- Attaching the correct label is not what's important, it's finding out how to treat a piece of software\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\n[www.esciencecenter.nl](https://www.esciencecenter.nl)\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 -

The software is stored in memory and on a hard disk rather than on cardboard (remember, one card per line...). Modern software often builds on other software, or used specific parts of other software packages, rather than re-defining the wheel.\n\nHowever, it ultimately still basically does the same: Software is a set of instructions that tells hardware what to do.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n\n## Complexity of modern software\n\n<img src=\"media/VScode_snapshot.png\" width=\"70%\">\n<small>Screenshot of source code for <a href=\"https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank2\">DeepRank2</a></small>\n\n<!-- Speaker notes -->\nNote:\nIn this image, we can get a glimpse of the complexity of modern software. We can see that software has a certain structure (indicated by differently colored text), is often composed of many lines of code (right side of image shows the entire length of the code), and is split over multiple intercommunicating files (left).\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n\n## Software is a form of data\n\n<img src=\"media/data_definition.png\" width=\"70%\">\n<small>Definition by <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data/\">Merriam-Webster English Dictionary</a></small>\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software is data\n\nSoftware can be ...\n\n- stored as bits\n- read, loaded, and processed\n- input and/or output\n- can be assigned a DOI, licence, etc\n\n<!-- Speaker notes -->\nNote:\n- Software is stored as bits and read from disk, loaded into memory, and processed similar to other types of data. \n- Software can be input, and software can be output. In fact, one of the major breakthroughs in computer science was when people realized that the instructions of the machine could be handled and stored the same as the data that it operated on. \n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## BUT\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software is a special type of data\n\nSoftware is...\n\n- **complex**: it is creatively generated, interconnected, and multi-layered\n- **interdependent**: it builds upon and therefore depends on other software (and data)\n- **executable**: it needs to be run to have a value (e.g. to process data)\n- **fragile**: its surroundings are dynamic, it can (and will) break soon and therefore needs to be regularly updated \n\n<!-- Speaker notes -->\nNote:\nWhile technically, software is a special kind of data (in that it is representation of information in a digital state), they are in essence quite different.\n\n- Complexity; it is not a single file, but a collection of files that are interconnected and multi-layered, and do not necessarily stand on their own. Software is also the result of a creative process that provides a tool to do something, and not the result of a measurement or observation.\n- Interdependence; software is often built using other software, and rarely built completely from scratch. This makes it dependent on other existing applications, which themselves may also change over time. In the context of research software it also often depends on the data, data formats, data standards, metadata, etc, which also change when new equipment becomes available.\n- Executability; software is in its dryest form a set of instructions that can be an archive of a procedure. However, the main goal of software is that these instructions can be executed. While most forms of data can stand on their own (e.g. I can look at the list of ages of all the people in a room and make conclusions about average age, etc.), software cannot be directly interpreted (only in the context of what it does).\n- Fragility; its interdependence and context-dependency drives software to require maintenance to retain its value, and this maintenance is not straightforward. Versioning of software is very common, while data is often static (though versions may happen).\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software requires dedicated maintenance\n\n- Software needs to be actively maintained to remain useable.\n  - This is contrary to 'regular' data, which is expected to remain static forever.\n- Maintenance is often lacking in academic contexts\n  - lack of funding\n  - lack of incentives/rewards\n  - lack of understanding and expertise (maintenance is a different from creation)\n  - individualistic work with fast turnover\n\n\n<!-- Speaker notes -->\nNote:\n'Regular' data can sometimes be versioned, but this is more the exception than the rule.\n\nRegarding the reasons for lack of maintenance:\n- funding opportunities for this do exist, but are rare and usually only for large projects\n- while you can sometimes publish a major update to a software package, this is also rare, and will even more rarely result in a high-impact/highly cited paper. it is also not highly appreciated e.g. on a CV.\n- while academics can often create software that \"does the job\" well, a different skill set is required to maintain the software (or write it in a way to facilitate maintenance)\n- academics often work on projects by themselves and then move on soon after their papers are published, leaving a knowledge gap for others to maintain the software\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software vs data management\n\n<ul style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n  <li>Software is a <strong>living thing</strong></li>\n  <li>Good data management will not ensure good software management</li>\n  <li>While some FAIR data management practices apply directly to software, others do not apply as easily\n    <ul>\n      <li>see <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x\">FAIR software paper</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>There is a thriving open-software community that has generated many tools and standards to facilitate good practices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"media/FAIR-software-paper.png\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"FAIR Software Paper\" style=\"display: block; border-style: none; margin: 0 auto;\">\n\nNote:\nThe different nature of software also provides opportunities but also requires extra thought on its management.\nSoftware is a living thing, and therefore it is easier to adopt good practices early on.\nCrucially, there is a community driven openness in software that long predates the open science movement.\nThis is not to say that software is inherently open, but that there is a broad open culture, which also comes with existing tools and pathways to facilitate openness and transparency.\nConsider GitHub (and other code hosting platforms), which are designed for this purpose.\nConsider also version control software, a good software development practice that builds in provenance.\n\n===\n\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Take home messages\n\n- Software are the instructions that tell the hardware (computer) what to do\n- Software is a 'living thing'\n- We need extra and different techniques for good software management\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\n[www.esciencecenter.nl](https://www.esciencecenter.nl)\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/softwarelandscape/exercise1","_dir":"softwarelandscape","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Study & present","description":"","type":"exercise","order":2,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"exercise-study-and-present-20-30-minutes-for-2-5-groups"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Exercise: Study and present (20 - 30 minutes for 2-5 groups)"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Pick a concept, initiative or organization from this module's "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"/modules/softwarelandscape/slides"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"slide deck"}]},{"type":"text","value":" or the "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"/main/yellowpages"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"yellow pages"}]},{"type":"text","value":" related to the Research Software Landscape (or find one you think should be there and while you are at it, "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"/main/contribute"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"start a contribution"}]},{"type":"text","value":")."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Then do a little research:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"find-out-the-following-10-minutes"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Find out the following (10 minutes):"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ol","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What kind of \"thing\" did you choose?

2022](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068), and since then there have been many efforts for adopting them.\n\nTheir paper [Introducing the FAIR principles for research software](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x) describes in more practical terms how FAIR can be applied to software.\n\n### FAIR software (20 minutes, optional)\n\nWhile the interpretation of the FAIR4RS working group has been the dominant set of principles since its publication, it was not the first attempt to apply FAIR to software.\n[This paper by Anna Lena Lamprecht et al.](https://doi.org/10.3233/ds-190026) was published a few years earlier, and also described an extension of the FAIR principles for software.\nThe paper is a more elaborate in its descriptions of software, the different aspects of software, and how they are or are not addressed by FAIR.\nIt is a good read if you want to get a deeper understanding of software and its relation to the FAIR principles.\n\n### FAIR Research Software Principles adoption\n\nThe blog post [The FAIR for Research Software Principles after two years: an adoption update](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2024-03/) contains a summary of these efforts.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/softwarelandscape/slides","_dir":"softwarelandscape","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Landscape","description":"===","type":"slides","order":1,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"the-research-software-landscape"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The

href=\"https://github.com/c-martinez\">Carlos Martinez-Ortiz</a></small>\n\nWhat role does research software play in promoting reproducibility?\n\nNote:\nReproducibility of research allows validation of its findings, and is therefore vital in building a solid foundation for scientific progress.\nWe can only truly build upon existing research if we can reproduce its results.\n\nWhen software has been used in research, this has enormous potential to facilitate the research reproducibility.\nHowever, it also comes with its own particular challenges: software reproducibility is not always straightforward.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software reusability\n\n- Reproducibility relies on re-using research software.\n  - Users need to **find**, **access**, and **use** the software.\n- Reproduction may just be a first step towards diversifying a study.\n  - Users need to **understand** the software.\n\nSoftware reusability encompasses both **reproducing** existing results obtained with RS, as well as **building upon** existing RS to use it in new or different ways.\n\nSoftware Management Plans help developers ensuring that their research software is reusable.\n\n\nNote:\nAn additional feature of software, is that it may be a product on its own, and can be reused by others.\nThis is a great opportunity to build on our collective knowledge and tools, and to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n\nEnsuring that the software is findable, accessible, usable, and understandable is key to both reproducibility and reusability.\n\nSoftware needs to be understood both from a:\n- functional perspective: what steps does the software take to get to the results\n- developmental perspective: how are these steps put into code\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Overview\n\n<!-- TODO change to reflect actual structure -->\n\n- Software Management Plan: what and why?\n- Aspects of software management\n- Different needs for different software\n- SMP guided questionnaire\n\nNote:\nThis presentation will introduce you to the concept of software management plans, as a first step towards better software stewardship and sustainability.\nWe will look at different aspects of good software managements, as well as different needs for different types of software.\nFinally, we will take a look at how to create a software management plan.\n\nAbout the \"Different needs for different software\": an SMP can sometimes be very short. To not frighten people that they have to create an extensive big SMP for each case; the SMP is just meant as a tool to help you think about software management.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Software Management Plan (SMP)\n\n- Building on the success of Data Management Plans (DMPs)\n- A document detailing how research software will be managed\n  - What does it do?\n  - Who is it for?\n  - What resources does it need?\n  - Who is responsible?\n  - How long will it be available?\n- Can be part of a project proposal or generated in the early phases\n\n> An SMP is a \"living document\", to be updated as plans change!\n\n\nNote:\nSoftware management plans (SMPs) are inspired by the earlier adopted data management plans.\nIn these documents, often created at or before the start of a project, plans and explicit decisions are made about various aspects around the management of these digital objects.\nThey are increasingly required by funders and institutions.\n\nIn an SMP it is explicitly stated what the software aims to do, who its target audience is, and what resources it is expected to need.\nIt also addresses the intended lifespan, and allocates responsibility: who makes releases? Who maintains the software at the end of the project, and if so for how long?\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## An SMP helps ...\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 10px; text-align: center;\">\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"media/benefits/purpose.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n    <sub>... thinking about<br>purpose & necessity</sub>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"media/benefits/resources.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n    <sub>... planning<br>resource management</sub>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"media/benefits/problems_later.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n    <sub>... avoiding<br>problems later</sub>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 10px; text-align: center; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;\">\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"media/benefits/structure.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n    <sub>... structuring<br>development</sub>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"./media/benefits/explicit.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n    <sub>... making technical<br>choices explicit</sub>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"media/benefits/alive.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n    <sub>... keeping research<br>software alive</sub>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<small>Images generated by OpenAI's DALL·E 3 model via ChatGPT v2 and subsequently adapted by <a href=\"https://github.com/DaniBodor\">Dani Bodor</a>.</small>\n\nNote:\n\nWith an SMP, you make explicit plans and decisions in an early stage.\nThe SMP provides the team with structured, relevant questions early on, with the aim to maximize the accessibility, reusability, and impact of the software in question.\nThis supports good software management practices, and it makes sure they are known to the researchers involved.\n\nMore specifically, in an SMP you:\n\n- Make explicit technical choices. For example, what programming language will be used? What operating system will be supported?\n- Plan for necessary resources; be they financial, human, infrastructure or other.\n- Assess whether new software is really needed; explore whether existing software can be reused, and to what extent;\n\nThese are issues that arise during software development anyway, but all too often are not explicitly dealt with.\nBy tackling them early, a conscious decision can be made rather than needing to deal with consequences of implicit choices.\nResource planning moreover is vital for the sustainability of the software.\nFinally, the SMP will allow later verification of plans in a publicly funded project.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## An SMP is not ...\n\nan additional bureaucratic hoop for researchers to jump through.\n\nMake sure you represent it as a tool allowing researchers to get the most out of their effort.  \n\nNote:\n\nIt is a common trap to present such documents to researchers and \"force\" them\nto fill them in without too much context. This is then often perceived as a\nbureaucratic burden that is not done with a lot of care or attention. \n\nInstead, we recommend presenting SMPs as an agent allowing researchers to\nminimize their efforts, by making considerations early in the process and\nworking towards their goals, rather than having to make the call in the moment,\nwhen there may be other priorities/deadlines (publication, grant application,\n...)\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Not all software is equal\n\n![](media/softwarespectrum2.png)\n\nNote:\nIt is important to realize when making an SMP, that research software comes in many shapes and sizes.\n\nAn ad-hoc R script written by a PhD student to analyse data from a specific machine, is research software.\n\nIt can also be a multinational collaboration to develop a tool that is used by thousands of researchers worldwide.\n\nDifferent software has different needs, but there are common principles in managing them and ensuring their sustainability.\n\nThe diversity of research software does mean that not all requirements apply to every type of software.\nTo address this, we can subset the core requirements to create different SMP templates tailored to software with different management needs.\n\nThe SMP Guide distinguishes software with low, medium, and high management needs.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"media/smpguide.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n[doi:10.5281/zenodo.7038280](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7038280)\n\n</center>\n\nNote:\nTo get started on creating a Software Management Plan, this practical guide has been created by NWO and the Netherlands eScience Center.\nIts first version was released in August of 2022, but it has since been, and will continue to be, updated.\nAll past versions and the latest release are available on Zenodo via this DOI.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## SMP Guided Questionnaire\n\n[smp.research.software](https://smp.research.software)\n\n<dl>\n<dt>1.

Software Testing\ntype: reading\norder: 2\n---\n\n## Software Testing (5 minutes)\n\nSoftware testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that software and its components meet specified requirements and function as expected. This critical step in the software development lifecycle ensures that the final product is reliable, functional, and free of significant defects.\n\nThe primary goal of software testing is to identify defects, errors, flaws, or bugs early in the development process. By detecting issues early, developers can address them before the software is released, reducing the risk of costly fixes and enhancing overall quality. Software testing can be conducted manually, where a human tester actively uses the software, performing various actions and observing the results to detect any anomalies or unexpected behavior. Alternatively, automated testing utilizes test scripts or tools to execute tests automatically, which is efficient for repetitive tasks and can quickly cover a wide range of test scenarios.\n\nUntested software can be likened to uncalibrated experimental devices. Just as uncalibrated instruments may provide inaccurate data and lead to erroneous conclusions, untested software can contain hidden defects that compromise its reliability and performance, potentially leading to critical failures in real-world applications; see optional section below.\n\n### What can tests help you do?\n\nTests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, validity, and reproducibility of your software's results. They help users easily verify that they have correctly installed your software, often providing examples of how to use it effectively. Tests also enable other developers to contribute to your software and make modifications with confidence, knowing that nothing is breaking.\n\nAdditionally, tests preserve expected functionality by ensuring that new changes do not introduce unintended side effects. They manage complexity by encouraging code that is easier to test, which in turn makes it easier to understand and maintain.\n\n### Types of Testing\n\nThere are several types of tests used in software development, each serving a specific purpose to ensure the quality and functionality of the software.\n\n- **Smoke Tests**: Also known as \"verification testing\", \"confidence testing\" or \"sanity testing\", smoke tests are a preliminary type of testing that checks the basic functionality of the software. They are often used to determine if a new build is stable enough to proceed with more detailed testing. Smoke tests quickly identify major issues that could prevent the software from functioning at a basic level.\n\n- **Unit Tests**: These tests focus on individual functions or components of the software, testing them one at a time. Unit tests are designed to validate that each function performs as expected in isolation, ensuring that the smallest parts of the codebase work correctly.\n\n- **Integration Tests**: These tests evaluate how different parts of the software work together. Integration tests are crucial for identifying issues that arise when components interact, ensuring that the integrated parts function seamlessly as a whole.\n\n- **System Tests**: These tests involve evaluating the entire software system running in an environment that simulates real-world conditions. System tests aim to verify that the software meets all specified requirements and performs well under expected usage scenarios.\n\n- **Regression Tests**: These tests are used to ensure that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality. By checking that the software produces the same results as before the changes, regression tests help maintain stability and prevent the reintroduction of previously fixed bugs.\n\n## Examples of untested research software (40 minutes, optional)\n\nThere are several examples in which the lack of proper software testings resulted in serious consequences. Here are a few interesting cases:\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25\n  - (1980) A tragic example of software bugs leading to loss of life, the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine had a flaw in its software, which resulted in patients receiving lethal doses of radiation.\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_V88\n  - (1996) This European Space Agency rocket was destroyed just 40 seconds after its launch due to a software bug.\n\n- https://www.wired.com/2010/11/1110mars-climate-observer-report/\n  - (1999) The loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999 is another prominent example of a catastrophe caused by a software error, specifically a unit conversion mistake.\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem\n  - (2000) The Y2K bug was a widespread computer flaw that was expected to cause chaos as the date changed from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000.\n\n- https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.314.5807.1856\n  - (2006) A software flaw (a plus sign which should have been a minus) lead to a retraction of 5 scientific articles.\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Capital_Group\n  - (2013) Knight Capital, a financial services firm, lost around $440 million within less than an hour due to a software glitch in its trading algorithms.\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings\n  - (2018-2019) Software issues with the Boeing 737 MAX's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) were implicated in two fatal crashes\n\n- https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/chemists-discover-cross-platform-python-scripts-not-so-cross-platform/\n  - (2019) Researchers found that a programming error in a set of Python scripts commonly used for computational analysis of chemistry data returned varying results based on which operating system they were run on—throwing doubt on the results of more than 150 published chemistry studies."},{"_path":"/modules/version-control","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Version Control","description":"Photo by Kelsy Gagnebin on Unsplash","order":1,"trl":"high","category":"Developing Software","abstract":"Local version control and collaborative code development, for example using Git and GitHub","author":"eScience Center, TU Delft","thumbnail":"thumbnail-version-control.jpg","visibility":"visible","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Photo by "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://unsplash.com/@kelsymichael?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Kelsy Gagnebin"}]},{"type":"text","value":" on "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-stack-of-books-R52YghRa_Ik?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Unsplash"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:version-control:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/version-control/index.md","_stem":"modules/version-control/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\norder: 1\ntrl: high\ncategory: Developing Software\ntitle: Software Version Control\nabstract: Local version control and collaborative code development, for example using Git and GitHub\nauthor: eScience Center, TU Delft\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-version-control.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kelsymichael?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Kelsy Gagnebin</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-stack-of-books-R52YghRa_Ik?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>\n  "},{"_path":"/modules/version-control/info","_dir":"version-control","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Learning objectives","description":"In this module you will learn to answer the following questions:","type":"info","order":0,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In this module you will learn to answer the following questions:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Explain what version control of research software is"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Illustrate the importance of using version control"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Identify when in the research cycle to employ version control"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Compare the use of local and remote version control"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"List the various tools or systems for version control"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Identify relevant resources for researchers about features commonly used in version control"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:version-control:info.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/version-control/info.md","_stem":"modules/version-control/info","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Learning objectives\ntype: info\norder: 0\n---\n\nIn this module you will learn to answer the following questions:\n\n- Explain what version control of research software is\n- Illustrate the importance of using version control\n- Identify when in the research cycle to employ version control\n- Compare the use of local and remote version control\n- List the various tools or systems for version control\n- Identify relevant resources for researchers about features commonly used in version control\n"},{"_path":"/modules/version-control/slides-version-control","_dir":"version-control","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Version Control Slides","description":"What is version control and why should I use it?","type":"slides","order":1,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"version-control"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Version Control"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is version control and why should I use it?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"note:\nYou are probably using version control every day.

Word and other documents store a history of changes for you, which you can undo. Google Docs have an even more intricate system of reviewing history, etc.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n### Version Control\n\n*A system that organizes and records changes to a (set of) file(s) and/or their metadata over time, allowing one to\nrevisit specific versions later.*\n\n<div class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">\n  <img src=\"https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/phd101212s.png\" width=\"38%\">\n  <small> <a href=\"https://phdcomics.com\">Piled Higher and Deeper</a> by Jorge Cham </small>\n</div>\n\nnote:\nStrictly speaking, this is a form of version control: separate versions are stored, commented on, and organized in some way.\n\nLet's see a more practical, systematic, and robust way of doing this...\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\"  -->\n## Documents are...\n\n<div>\n  ... a series of changes\n  <img style=\"height: 30vh; margin: 0; padding: 0;\" src=\"https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/play-changes.svg\"/>\n</div>\n\nnote:\nIn version control systems, documents start with a base version (which may or may not be empty) and record all the changes that happened on top of that base version. Because of this you can always \"play back\" to an earlier version or compare separate iterations, without having to store near-identical variations of the same documents.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\"  -->\n## Software is...\n\n... a collection of one or more documents.\n\n- Code\n- Documentation\n- Environment & infrastructural files\n- ...\n\n\nnote:\nAny piece of code is nothing more than a (plain) text document, not too different from a Word file. The same is generally true for most other files comprising the software. Therefore, changes are excessively easy and computationally efficient to track.\n\nEven complex (binary, data, image, ...) files can ultimately be rendered in plain text, and therefore tracked using version control. Although changes are not easy to visualize and it will require multiplying the data storage for each change.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n## Changes...\n\n... are stored using a version control (VC) system (usually `git`).\n\n<img src=\"media/git-diff.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\nA single unit of change is called a [commit](version_control_terminology), and is typically associated with a brief [commit message](version_control_terminology), [commit hash](version_control_terminology) (SHA), and other metadata.\n<!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" -->\n\nnote:\nCommit hashes are unique references to a commit, while commit messages are human readable descriptions. Other metadata can include the author(s), timestamp, etc.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\"  -->\n## A commit...\n\n... can be of any size or type:\n\n- Single line additions/deletions/changes\n- Additions/deletions/changes of (multiple) large sections\n- Adding or deleting files\n- Moving files into different folders\n- ...\n\nnote:\nA commit is the fundamental unit of change in version control, but its scope is not strictly defined.\n\nIdeally, a commit should be large enough to represent a meaningful improvement while remaining small enough to focus on a single, coherent change. Balancing these factors helps maintain clarity and makes it easier to track, review, and revert changes when needed.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard center\" -->\n## Sequential commits...\n\n... form a log\n\nThe data structure that contains the software plus the commit history is called a [repository](version_control_terminology).\n\n<img src=\"media/git-log.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\nnote:\nA good rule of thumb for commit sizing is whether you can write a clear, concise commit message summarizing the change. If the commit is too small, the message will simply describe the specific action taken. If it's too large, summarizing it succinctly becomes difficult. Striking the right balance ultimately also allows the commit log to be read almost like a history book.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## Keeping track\n\n#### Question:\nSay you have dozens (hundreds, thousands, ...) of old versions, how do you manage to find a specific/useful previous version?\n\n- Effective committing (sizing & messages)\n<!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" -->\n- Versioning systems\n<!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" -->\n- Create Change logs and DOIs for stable/important versions\n<!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" -->\n\nnote:\nWe've talked above extensively about commit hygiene, so will now discuss the other 2 aspects.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Versioning\n\nUse a logical system to keep track of (stable) versions<br>\n... and document the system used in the repository.\n\nThe most common are:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning (SemVer)</a>, and\n    <li><a href=\"https://calver.org/\">Calendar Versioning (CalVer)</a>.\n</ul>\n\nnote:\nMake sure that whatever versioning system you use is also documented in the repo, so that others (and future you) can see what the logic is.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## SemVer Terminology\n\nMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\n\n- MAJOR: backwards incompatible changes\n  - ⚠️ MAJOR=0: API may change any time\n- MINOR: added backwards incompatible functionality\n- PATCH: backwards compatible bugfixes\n- 1.0.0 defines public API\n\nnote:\nNot every change or addition needs a new version number;

We recommend against using any of the other tools unless the users already know what they are doing or have very strong reasons for doing so.\n\nGitLab is fully open source and offers a self-managed option, allowing organizations to host and manage their own GitLab instances on-premises or in their private cloud environments. This provides full control over data and customization.\n\nConversely, GitHub is owned by Microsoft and uses (some) proprietary software, but is more widely used and more people will be familiar with the interface and functionality.

Therefore it is a good idea for teams to agree on some basic practices to avoid creating conflicts in the first place.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## Avoiding merge conflicts\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 2fr); gap: 10; text-align: center;\">\n  <div class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">\n    <div>\n      <img src=\"media/communication.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n      <strong>Communication</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Who is working on what?</li>\n        <li>Follow or create common standards</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\">\n    <div>\n      <img src=\"media/updating.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n      <strong>Frequent updates</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li><a href=\"version_control_terminology\">push and pull</a> changes regularly</li>\n        <li>Review each other's work before merging</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"3\">\n    <div>\n      <img src=\"media/workflow.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n      <strong>Organized workflow</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Commit hygiene and feature branches</li>\n        <li>Avoid \"scope creep\"</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"4\">\n    <div>\n      <img src=\"media/tools.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n      <strong>Tools are your friends</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li><em>Kanban boards</em> for task assignment</li>\n        <li><em>linters</em> for style adherence</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<small>All icons from <a href=\"https://icons8.com/icons/pricing\">Icons8</a></small>\n\nnote:\n\nKeep in mind, that it is unrealistic to prevent all conflicts. This is fine, but they will need some attention to resolve.\n\nCommunication is key!\n\nIn general: The more files you touch, the shorter the branch should live to avoid merge conflicts\n\nA strategy to specifically avoid is a \"one branch per student\" model: such branches\nusually end up diverging so much that they end up never getting merged.\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## Short-lived Feature Branches\n\nOne dedicated branch for one task (feature)\n\n<div class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">\n  <strong>Iterate quickly:</strong>\n  <br>\n  <ul>\n    <li>create branch</li>\n    <li>make changes</li>\n    <li>merge changes</li>\n    <li>delete branch</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\nNote:\n\nA task can be anything, small or large: fixing a typo, updating a reference, adding some documentation,\nfixing a bug, adding some new functionality, improving performance, performing a backend rewrite.\n\nDeleting branches after merging helps keeping the overview of what is actively being worked on.\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## Key Points\n- Version control is like unlimited undo in MS Word... and more!\n- Version control streamlines

In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software.\n\n## Teaching this lesson?\nDo you want to teach Research Software Support? This material is open-source and freely available. \nAre you planning on using our material in your teaching? \nWe would love to help you prepare to teach the lesson and receive feedback on how it could be further improved, based on your experience in the workshop.\n\nYou can notify us that you plan to teach this lesson by creating an issue in this repository. Also, it would be great if you can update [this overview of all workshops taught with this lesson material](main/workshops.md). This helps us show the impact of developing open-source lessons to our funders.\n\n## Target audience\nThe target audience for this material is University management and support staff. University management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software. The University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions to the content of the Research Software Support platform. Please view [the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Technical documentation\nThis platform uses the [NEBULA framework](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA).\n\nFor elaborate setup instructions and other documentation, see the [NEBULA documentation](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs)\n\n## Quick local setup\n\nMore detailed information about local setup can be found in the [NEBULA local rendering docs](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs/blob/main/local-rendering.md)\n\n### Content directory/repository\n\nTo use NEBULA to build the content in this repository locally, you will need to clone this repository and the NEBULA repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support.git\ngit clone git@github.com:esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA.git\n```\n\n### Link to the content repository\n\nTo make sure that NEBULA knows where to find the content, we create the following environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport CONTENT_PATH=\"/path/to/your/content/repository\"\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\n\nCheck whether you have node and npm installed:\n```bash\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n```\nThe above commands should output the installed versions, *e.g.*, `10.6.0` and `v20.9.0`.\n\nIf this is not the case, proceed with installing the [node package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).\n\nFirst, [use nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script), the \"node version manager\", this is a shell script that enables the installation, management and use of multiple versions of the node runtime environment and package manager.\n\n```bash\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n```\n\nNow, install the the node Javascript runtime environment which includes the node package manager (npm):\n```bash\nnvm install node\n```\n\nFinally, you can use npm (node package manager) to install the dependencies of NEBULA. Navigate to the NEBULA respository:\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/NEBULA/repository\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Local development build\n\nNavigate to the NEBULA folder and run\n\n```bash\n# node package manager\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNow you can open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/research-software-support`\n"}],"navigation":[{"title":"Config","_path":"/config"},{"title":"Contributing
