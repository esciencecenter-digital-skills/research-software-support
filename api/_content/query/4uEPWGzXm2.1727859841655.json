Non-academic researchers should also be credited for their software work, though the specific forms of credit are different than for academic researchers.\n\n**Discovering Software**: Citations enable the specific software used in a research product to be found. Additional researchers can then use the same software for different purposes, leading to credit for those responsible for the software.\n\n**Reproducibility**: Citation of specific software used is necessary for reproducibility, although not sufficient. Additional information such as configurations and platform issues are also needed.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## The software citation principles\n\n- Importance\n- Credit and attribution\n- Unique Identification\n- Persistence\n- Accessibility\n- Specificity\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n**Importance**: Software should be considered a legitimate and citable product of research. Software citations should be accorded the same importance in the scholarly record as citations of other research products, such as publications and data; they should be included in the metadata of the citing work, for example in the reference list of a journal article, and should not be omitted or separated. Software should be cited on the same basis as any other research product such as a paper or a book, that is, authors should cite the appropriate set of software products just as they cite the appropriate set of papers.\n\n**Credit and Attribution**: Software citations should facilitate giving scholarly credit and normative, legal attribution to all contributors to the software, recognizing that a single style or mechanism of attribution may not be applicable to all software.\n\n**Unique Identification**: A software citation should include a method for identification that is machine actionable, globally unique, interoperable, and recognized by at least a community of the corresponding domain experts, and preferably by general public researchers.\n\n**Persistence**: Unique identifiers and metadata describing the software and its disposition should persist â€“ even beyond the lifespan of the software they describe.\n\n**Accessibility**: Software citations should facilitate access to the software itself and to its associated metadata, documentation, data, and other materials necessary for both humans and machines to make informed use of the referenced software.\n\n**Specificity**: Software citations should facilitate identification of, and access to, the specific version of software that was used. Software identification should be as specific as necessary, such as using version numbers, revision numbers, or variants such as platforms.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## What software to cite?\n\n*\"\"...the software itself should be cited on the same basis as any other research product; authors should cite the appropriate set of software products.\"*\n\nWhich software would you cite?\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## How to make your software citable?\n##  \n## `CITATION.cff`\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n```\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n  - family-names: Druskat\n    given-names: Stephan\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/1234-5678-9101-1121\ntitle: \"My Research Software\"\nversion: 2.0.4\nidentifiers:\n  - type: doi\n    value: 10.5281/zenodo.1234\ndate-released: 2021-08-11\n```\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/distributing/exercise-tracking","_dir":"distributing","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Dependency tracking","description":"","type":"exercise","order":3,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:distributing:exercise-tracking.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/distributing/exercise-tracking.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Dependency tracking\ntype: exercise\norder: 3\n---\n\n## Dependency tracking (10 minutes)\n\nA common place to specify dependencies is in a file called `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` or `environment.yml`. \n\nGo into a source code repository of a piece of software you know and try to track down dependencies. Try to also find the soruce code of one of the dependencies and see if you can find the dependencies of this dependency.
