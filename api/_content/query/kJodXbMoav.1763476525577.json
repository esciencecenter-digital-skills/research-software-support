many reasons and motivations come to mind.\nYou may think of:\n\n- Accuracy of results\n- Reproducibility of results\n- Reusability of software\n- User friendliness of software\n- Software quality\n- Recognition and rewards for software developers\n- Scholarly archive\n- Software sustainability\n\nDo any other reasons or motivation come to mind?\nFor each reason, score how generally applicable

take a look at the chapter on [Software Landscapes](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) before doing the following exercise.)\n\nThe motivations we listed above were important considerations for the development of Software Management Plans as well as the FAIR principles for research software.\nThey do not match completely, however.\nEach has its own focus and emphasis.\n\nIn the following
