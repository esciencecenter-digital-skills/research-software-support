Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\n- [ ] **Substantial scholarly effort:** Does this submission meet the scope eligibility described in the [JOSS guidelines](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#substantial-scholarly-effort)\n- [ ] **Data sharing:** If the paper contains original data, data are accessible to the reviewers. If the paper contains no original data, please check this item.\n- [ ] **Reproducibility:** If the paper contains original results, results are entirely reproducible by reviewers. If the paper contains no original results, please check this item.\n- [ ] **Human and animal research:** If the paper contains original data research on humans subjects or animals, does it comply with [JOSS's human participants research policy and/or animal research policy](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/policies.html?highlight=animal#joss-policies)? If the paper contains no such data, please check this item.\n\n### Functionality\n\n- [ ] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\n- [ ] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\n- [ ] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] **A statement of need**: Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\n- [ ] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\n- [ ] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\n- [ ] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\n- [ ] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified?\n- [ ] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support.\n\nSkip the last category *Software paper*\n\n## Step 3: How was the reviewing process?\n\nReflect on the difficulty of the review process.\nWhich advantages has this review process?\nAre there projects in which you are currently working that would pass this review?\n"},{"_path":"/modules/publication/register_software_rsd_exercise","_dir":"publication","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Register your software","description":"For this exercise, you will create a practice software page on the  RSD playground.

This playground will be cleared at some point after this course, so don't try to make it too perfect.\n\nFirst, think of one of your own software packages that you would like to make a page out of. If you don't have one available, choose one of the examples below and try to mimic it:\n\n- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)\n- [Kernel Tuner](https://research-software-directory.org/software/kernel-tuner)\n- [Citation File Format](https://research-software-directory.org/software/citation-file-format)\n- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)\n- [NEBULA](https://research-software-directory.org/software/nebula)\n- [Chemistry Development Kit](https://research-software-directory.org/software/cdk)\n- [Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM)](https://research-software-directory.org/software/pism)\n- [GGIR](https://research-software-directory.org/software/ggir)\n- [DeepRank](https://research-software-directory.org/software/deeprank)\n\nSign in with a 'local account' (by entering any username you want), click on the plus sign on the top right and select 'New Software'.\n\nThe goal is to get familiar with all aspects of creating a software page, so don't try to add e.g. 20 contributors to a page, but just add a few and try out all features.\n"}]
