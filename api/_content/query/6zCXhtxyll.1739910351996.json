It provides a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for this purpose.\n\n- PureGoMe can be downloaded from the project repository, while metadata is accessible independently from the registry.\n- PuReGoMe's GitHub repository has detailed records of the development history.\n- The code includes dependencies to other software, such as various Python libraries.\n- PuReGoMe has a (versioned) DOI from Zenodo.\n- PuReGoMe uses the Apache 2.0 open source licence.\n- PuReGoMe uses standard file formats (e.g., CSV files) for data exchange.\n- PuReGoMe refers to other objects such as websites.\n- PureGoMe is registered in the Research Software Directory that captures the most relevant metadata, including the identifier, in searchable and indexable form.\n\n### Software 3: [gammaShiny](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4139005)\n\n[gammaShiny](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4139005) is an application that provides enhanced graphical user interfaces for the R gamma package8. It is used to process in-situ gamma-ray spectrometry measurements for luminescence dating.\n\n- gammaShiny has been deposited in the HAL French national archive and it has a persistent globally unique identifier, with the HAL identifier of the metadata record and a SWHID, identifying specifically the software artefact on the Software Heritage universal software source code archive.\n- Thanks to the HAL platform, where a licence is mandatory, gammaShiny is under a GNU General Public Licence v3.0.\n- The archived versions of gammaShiny’s source code in Software Heritage include a codemeta.json file, identifiable with a SWHID, where other metadata is available including dependencies named in CodeMeta (\"softwareRequirements\").\n\n### Do you agree?\n\nThe examples were taken from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x).\nIn the Results section of the paper you will find the authors' analysis of the software, which contains the statements above, mapped to the FAIR4RS Principles.\n\nDo you agree with their assessment?"}
