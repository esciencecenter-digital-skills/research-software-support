Non-academic researchers should also be credited for their software work, though the specific forms of credit are different than for academic researchers.\n\n**Discovering Software**: Citations enable the specific software used in a research product to be found. Additional researchers can then use the same software for different purposes, leading to credit for those responsible for the software.\n\n**Reproducibility**: Citation of specific software used is necessary for reproducibility, although not sufficient. Additional information such as configurations and platform issues are also needed.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## The software citation principles\n\n- Importance\n- Credit and attribution\n- Unique Identification\n- Persistence\n- Accessibility\n- Specificity\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n**Importance**: Software should be considered a legitimate and citable product of research. Software citations should be accorded the same importance in the scholarly record as citations of other research products, such as publications and data; they should be included in the metadata of the citing work, for example in the reference list of a journal article, and should not be omitted or separated. Software should be cited on the same basis as any other research product such as a paper or a book, that is, authors should cite the appropriate set of software products just as they cite the appropriate set of papers.\n\n**Credit and Attribution**: Software citations should facilitate giving scholarly credit and normative, legal attribution to all contributors to the software, recognizing that a single style or mechanism of attribution may not be applicable to all software.\n\n**Unique Identification**: A software citation should include a method for identification that is machine actionable, globally unique, interoperable, and recognized by at least a community of the corresponding domain experts, and preferably by general public researchers.\n\n**Persistence**: Unique identifiers and metadata describing the software and its disposition should persist â€“ even beyond the lifespan of the software they describe.\n\n**Accessibility**: Software citations should facilitate access to the software itself and to its associated metadata, documentation, data, and other materials necessary for both humans and machines to make informed use of the referenced software.\n\n**Specificity**: Software citations should facilitate identification of, and access to, the specific version of software that was used. Software identification should be as specific as necessary, such as using version numbers, revision numbers, or variants such as platforms.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## What software to cite?\n\n*\"\"...the software itself should be cited on the same basis as any other research product; authors should cite the appropriate set of software products.\"*\n\nWhich software would you cite?\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## How to make your software citable?\n##  \n## `CITATION.cff`\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n```\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n  - family-names: Druskat\n    given-names: Stephan\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/1234-5678-9101-1121\ntitle: \"My Research Software\"\nversion: 2.0.4\nidentifiers:\n  - type: doi\n    value: 10.5281/zenodo.1234\ndate-released: 2021-08-11\n```\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/documentation/exercise-levels","_dir":"documentation","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Levels of documentation","description":"Joanne is working on her research software 'WeatherMap' that analyses and summarizes measurements from weather stations.","type":"exercise","order":3,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:documentation:exercise-levels.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/documentation/exercise-levels.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Levels of documentation\ntype: exercise\norder: 3\n---\n\n# When to use which documentation?\nJoanne is working on her research software 'WeatherMap' that analyses and summarizes measurements from weather stations.\n\nHere is a list of possible forms of documentation:\n1. A basic README file containing: quick installation instructions, two lines explaining why the software was created, \ntwo basic examples of how you can use the software.\n2. A tutorial: 'Finding unusual patterns in daily average temperatures using WeatherMap'.\n3. In-code documentation: Comments in her code that explain why she made certain implementation choices.\n5. API reference: Detailed description of each function/class of WeatherMap.\n6. Overview of components: A detailed overview of each component in the software.\n7. User documentation: Extensive documentation on how users can use each of the functionalities of WeatherMap.\n8. Naming: Logical names for functions, modules, and classes so that it is immediately clear what the corresponding piece of code does.\n\n\nFor the following scenarios, which forms of documentation would you suggest Joanne to incorporate in her project:\n\n## Scenario A:\nJoanne just started her PhD and is the only one using WeatherMap to create results for her first paper. \nShe does not really care about anyone else using her software.\n\n## Scenario B:\nJoanne works together with a few other PhD students in her research group on the software. \nShe wants to make it easier for other researchers in her group to also adopt the software, \nand finds it important that when she moves on to a different job that the software can be still be used and improved in her absence.\n\n## Scenario C:\nJoanne and her colleagues spend half of their time updating and improving WeatherMap. \nThey have a large community of users around the globe that depend on WeatherMap for their research.\n"}]
