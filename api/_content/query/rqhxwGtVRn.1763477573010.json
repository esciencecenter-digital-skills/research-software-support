GitLab and GitHub are the mainstream, used by many and with lots of features. You might run into projects using other repositories. \n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Tag/semantic versioning\n\nIt is important to communicate the actual version of the software used for a particular piece of research\n\nIf your software is used as a dependency of another software/workflow then specific versions can be referenced\n\nIdeally, use \"semantic versioning\" in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. v2.1.5)\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Get a Persistent Identifier\n\nSpecific versions of the software should be published to an archiving service that provides persistent identifiers.\n\nFor example, Zenodo is a long term archiving service for scientific data and software.\nZenodo will assign a **D**igital **O**bject **I**dentifyer (**DOI**) to the published data, making it citable.\n\nNote:\n\nSee Citation story\n\n==\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Registries\nAdd a link to your software on a relevant public registry\n\n* For example, the eScience Center maintains the Research Software Directory\n* Can also be domain specific software registries\n* Or even list it on awesomelist\n\nThis aids greatly in Findability by relevant researchers\n\nNote:\nAn \"awesome list\" is a list of awesome things curated by the community, often hosted as a repository on GitHub.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### The Research Software Directory\n<style>\n.container{\n  display: flex;\n  text-align: start;\n}\n.col{\n  flex: 1;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n<div class=\"col\">\n<img src=\"media/rsd-front-page.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the front page of the RSD\">\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"col\" style=\"font-size: x-large\">\nThe Research Software Directory is an online service designed to <b>collect</b> and <b>present</b> “related research information” in a structured way.
