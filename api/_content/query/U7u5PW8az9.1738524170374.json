If you are interested in following or even hosting such a workshop, have a look at the [training page](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/digital-skills/) or contact the [training team](mailto:training@esciencecenter.nl) at the Netherlands eScience Center.\n\n\n## Past workshops\n\n| Date               | Organisation                 | Location                              | Comments                    |\n|-------------------:|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------|\n| 2023-11-28         | Netherlands eScience Center  | Amsterdam, The Netherlands            | Pilot workshop, VU          |\n| 2024-05-16         | Netherlands eScience Center  | Amsterdam, The Netherlands            | Pilot workshop, UvA/HvA     |\n| 2024-09-10         | Netherlands eScience Center  | Utrecht & Amsterdam, The Netherlands  | Split-day workshop          |\n| 2025-02-03         | Netherlands eScience Center  | Amsterdam, The Netherlands            | Split-day workshop, DCC-PO  |\n\n\n## Homework\n\nThese are potential homework exercises that can be used in a live workshop setting.\n\n### Research Software\n\n1. Find a piece of research software that you like (because of the topic or nice picture, or whetever other reason) from the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/software?page=1&rows=48).\n\n1. Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n"}]
