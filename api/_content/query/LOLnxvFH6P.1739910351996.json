(10 minutes)\n\nBelow are two cases where a researcher comes to you with a description of software they\nhave created and that they would like to distribute. Your challenge is to pick one and\nfigure out what to advise them on how best to get the software in the hands of its\naudience. Which questions would you ask to get to the bottom of things?\n\n### Case 1: The Solar Solution\n\nShamash is a senior researcher who leads a group. He shows up one day to ask for advice\non distributing some software that a junior researcher in his group has created. He\nsays: \"One of my people has made an amazing application for calculating where you can\nbest put solar panels, and how much energy they will produce. We think there are lots of\nresearchers studying the energy transition and working on solutions, and they should all\nuse our program because it's just so great. We're submitting a paper on solar panels in\nthe province next week, but how do we make the code available?\"\n\n### Case 2: The Miracle Model\n\nMarina is a young historian who studies historical natural disasters, who sends an email\nto ask for advice. She writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nDear research software support,\n\nI've been researching historical flood events in The Netherlands, and how they have\naffected politics and the economy. It's a fascinating topic that is also highly relevant\ntoday, as climate change-induced sea level rise is going to put low-lying areas around\nthe world at risk of flooding.\n\nI actually have a background in economics, so unlike most of my colleagues in the\nhumanities I've tried to take a quantitative approach, which is quite difficult because\nwe don't have much data and floods are quite rare. I've been working with a statistician\nwho specialises in rare events and we've modified some of the existing techniques a bit\nto work better for this case, and we got some really good results.\n\nWe submitted a paper some time ago, and now I've been asked to share the code. I don't\nknow how to do that though. Can you help me?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nMarina\n</blockquote>\n\n"},{"_path":"/modules/distributing","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Distribution","description":"Photo by frank mckenna on Unsplash","category":"Sharing Software","order":15,"abstract":"Software needs to be distributed to be used by others.
