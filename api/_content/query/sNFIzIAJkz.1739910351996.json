Non-academic researchers should also be credited for their software work, though the specific forms of credit are different than for academic researchers.\n\n**Discovering Software**: Citations enable the specific software used in a research product to be found. Additional researchers can then use the same software for different purposes, leading to credit for those responsible for the software.\n\n**Reproducibility**: Citation of specific software used is necessary for reproducibility, although not sufficient. Additional information such as configurations and platform issues are also needed.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## The software citation principles\n\n- Importance\n- Credit and attribution\n- Unique Identification\n- Persistence\n- Accessibility\n- Specificity\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n**Importance**: Software should be considered a legitimate and citable product of research. Software citations should be accorded the same importance in the scholarly record as citations of other research products, such as publications and data; they should be included in the metadata of the citing work, for example in the reference list of a journal article, and should not be omitted or separated. Software should be cited on the same basis as any other research product such as a paper or a book, that is, authors should cite the appropriate set of software products just as they cite the appropriate set of papers.\n\n**Credit and Attribution**: Software citations should facilitate giving scholarly credit and normative, legal attribution to all contributors to the software, recognizing that a single style or mechanism of attribution may not be applicable to all software.\n\n**Unique Identification**: A software citation should include a method for identification that is machine actionable, globally unique, interoperable, and recognized by at least a community of the corresponding domain experts, and preferably by general public researchers.\n\n**Persistence**: Unique identifiers and metadata describing the software and its disposition should persist â€“ even beyond the lifespan of the software they describe.\n\n**Accessibility**: Software citations should facilitate access to the software itself and to its associated metadata, documentation, data, and other materials necessary for both humans and machines to make informed use of the referenced software.\n\n**Specificity**: Software citations should facilitate identification of, and access to, the specific version of software that was used. Software identification should be as specific as necessary, such as using version numbers, revision numbers, or variants such as platforms.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## What software to cite?\n\n*\"...the software itself should be cited on the same basis as any other research product; authors should cite the appropriate set of software products.\"*\n\nWhich software would you cite?\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n## How to make your software citable?\n##  \n## `CITATION.cff`\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n```\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n  - family-names: Druskat\n    given-names: Stephan\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/1234-5678-9101-1121\ntitle: \"My Research Software\"\nversion: 2.0.4\nidentifiers:\n  - type: doi\n    value: 10.5281/zenodo.1234\ndate-released: 2021-08-11\n```\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/distributing/exercise-distributing","_dir":"distributing","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"How to distribute?","description":"","type":"exercise","order":3,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:distributing:exercise-distributing.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/distributing/exercise-distributing.md","_stem":"modules/distributing/exercise-distributing","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: How to distribute?\ntype: exercise\norder: 3\n---\n\n## How to distribute this software? (10 minutes)\n\nBelow are two cases where a researcher comes to you with a description of software they\nhave created and that they would like to distribute. Your challenge is to pick one and\nfigure out what to advise them on how best to get the software in the hands of its\naudience. Which questions would you ask to get to the bottom of things?\n\n### Case 1: The Solar Solution\n\nShamash is a senior researcher who leads a group. He shows up one day to ask for advice\non distributing some software that a junior researcher in his group has created. He\nsays: \"One of my people has made an amazing application for calculating where you can\nbest put solar panels, and how much energy they will produce. We think there are lots of\nresearchers studying the energy transition and working on solutions, and they should all\nuse our program because it's just so great. We're submitting a paper on solar panels in\nthe province next week, but how do we make the code available?\"\n\n### Case 2: The Miracle Model\n\nMarina is a young historian who studies historical natural disasters, who sends an email\nto ask for advice. She writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nDear research software support,\n\nI've been researching historical flood events in The Netherlands, and how they have\naffected politics and the economy. It's a fascinating topic that is also highly relevant\ntoday, as climate change-induced sea level rise is going to put low-lying areas around\nthe world at risk of flooding.\n\nI actually have a background in economics, so unlike most of my colleagues in the\nhumanities I've tried to take a quantitative approach, which is quite difficult because\nwe don't have much data and floods are quite rare. I've been working with a statistician\nwho specialises in rare events and we've modified some of the existing techniques a bit\nto work better for this case, and we got some really good results.\n\nWe submitted a paper some time ago, and now I've been asked to share the code. I don't\nknow how to do that though. Can you help me?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nMarina\n</blockquote>\n\n"}]
