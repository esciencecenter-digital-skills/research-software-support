A `CITATION.cff` file is a lightweight, machine-readable file that provides information about the software, its creators, and how it should be cited. This file can be included in the software, and should be easy to find and access.\n\nThere are even nice integrations with GitHub and Zenodo. \n\nHere is an example of a `CITATION.cff` file:\n\n```\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n  - family-names: Druskat\n    given-names: Stephan\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/1234-5678-9101-1121\ntitle: \"My Research Software\"\nversion: 2.0.4\nidentifiers:\n  - type: doi\n    value: 10.5281/zenodo.1234\ndate-released: 2021-08-11\n```\n"}]
