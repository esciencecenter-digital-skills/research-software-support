You can also use the physical space on your sheet of paper to group the various requirements together. \n\nFor this, use the following considerations (section 5 in [the guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7589725)):\n\n1. **Purpose**. What is the current reason or expected end-use for developing the software?\n2. **Reliability**. The effect of software failure and/or non-maintenance on:\n    - Risk of harm to self or others. This includes injury, privacy violation, bias, and inappropriate content.\n    - Reputation. For example to self, institution or other.\n    - Research, either your own or of others. This effect could be due to an obvious software failure (\"crash\") or a hidden one, for example, returning inconsistent numerical results on different operating systems.\n3. **Maintenance**. The long-term effort needed to maintain the software as long as it might be used as a standalone tool or dependency. This includes maintenance functions that can extend beyond the lifespan of the original development project and includes fixing bugs, dependency management, operating system compatibility, and security issues.\n\n\n## Step 3: Assess your template\n\n- Assess what level of management (low, medium, high) your custom template matches most. \n- What is different from your custom template and the default management level template? Does this difference make sense?\n- Finally use section 6 (Implementation Examples) from the [Practical Guide to Software Management Plans](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7589725) to create the Software Management Plan template with questions that a researcher/developer would have to answer. \n"},{"_path":"/modules/testing/exercise","_dir":"testing","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Testing Exercise","description":"","type":"exercise","order":4,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:testing:exercise.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/testing/exercise.md","_stem":"modules/testing/exercise","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Testing Exercise\ntype: exercise\norder: 4\n---\n\n# Exercise 2\n\n## Identify the test types in this story:\n\n<big>\nDuring the process of manufacturing a ballpoint pen, we see smoke coming out of one of our machines, so we halt production immediately, put out the fire, and check why it caught fire in the first place before continuing.\n\nWe can now start production. The cap, the body, the tail, the ink cartridge, and the ballpoint are produced separately and we check the quality of each component before assembly. Next we check that the cap and tail fit on the body and the ink cartridge fits inside. When everything is put together, we ensure that it writes properly and doesn't leak.\n\nIn the future, we plan to supply different colors of ink and will re-run these tests for each new colored pen.\n</big>\n"}]
