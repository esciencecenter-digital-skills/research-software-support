in science. A first thought may be its role in data collection and analysis. Further, it may play a role in designing experiments, based on models generated. It may _be_ the experiment itself, simulate a research outcome based on data or ideas entered; it may also be the \"brain\" behind controlling crucial instrumentation.\n\nWhat scientific software can you think of?\n\nWhat role does it play?\n\nAn example here: the Event Horizon Telescope, which took a \"picture\" of a black hole.\nThe \"telescope\" is not a single tool, but complex: a \"planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes\" (wikipedia).\nThe separate telescopes collect data that is synchronized with atomic clocks, and the data is combined at highly specialised supercomputers.\nThe data can be converted into an image using custom software.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## The research lifecycle\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"media/researchcycle.png\" alt=\"The Research Life Cycle\" width=\"55%\"/>\n</center>\n\n<small>Software is used all across the research lifecycle</small>\n\nNote:\n\nSoftware is used all across the research life cycle.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"media/definition.png\" width=\"55%\">\n</center>\n\n<small>definition of Research Software from the FAIR4RS working group</small>\n\nNote:\n\nA definition of research software, from the FAIR4RS working group.\nIt is important that not all software that is used in research is research software.\nFor example, a text editor that is used to write a paper is not research software.\nNor is powerpoint, a web browser, or the software used to guide the telescope.\nEven tools like R or Python are not necessarily research software.\nThe code written in R or Python for an analysis would be research software, however.\nJust like a custom-made Excel macro that is used to analyse data.\nOr a custom-made web application that is used to collect data.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Why the distinction?\n\n- Research software is an important asset and output of research\n- Enable proper attribution\n- Increase Findability and Reuse\n\nNote:\n\nThe distinction is important\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Take home messages\n\n- Software is an important part of research\n- Not all software used in research is research software\n- It is important to regard research software in the whole research lifecycle\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 -
