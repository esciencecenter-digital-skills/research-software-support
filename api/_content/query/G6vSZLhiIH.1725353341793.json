The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation.\nThe SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.\nTogether, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge.\nNumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world’s leading scientists and engineers.\n\nIs this \"research software\" or \"software in research\"?\n\n### Other software tools\nHow about other software tools you are familiar with?\nCan you provide an example of software you are familiar with, and then classify it as \"research software\" or \"software in research\"?\n"},{"_path":"/modules/researchsoftware","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Research software","description":"thumbnail-research-software","category":"Getting started","order":0,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":"What is software, how is it made and what makes research software so special?","thumbnail":"thumbnail-research-software.png","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:researchsoftware:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/researchsoftware/index.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Research software\ncategory: Getting started\norder: 0\nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: What is software, how is it made and what makes research software so special?\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-research-software.png\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n[thumbnail-research-software](https://unsplash.com/photos/colorful-software-or-web-code-on-a-computer-monitor-Skf7HxARcoc?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/colorful-software-or-web-code-on-a-computer-monitor-Skf7HxARcoc?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>\n\n\n\n\n"}]
