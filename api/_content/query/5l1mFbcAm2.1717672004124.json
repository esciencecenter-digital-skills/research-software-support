Gitlab and Github are the mainstream, used by many and with lots of features. You might run into projects using other repositories. \n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Tag/semantic versioning\n\nIt is important to communicate the actual version of the software used for a particular piece of research\n\nIf your software is used as a dependency of another software/workflow then specific versions can be referenced\n\nIdeally, use \"semantic versioning\" in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. v2.1.5)\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Get a Persistent Identifier\n\nSpecific versions of the software should be published to an archiving service that provides persistent identifiers\n\nFor example, Zenodo is a long term archiving service for scientific data and software.\nZenodo will assign a DOI to the published data, making it citable\n\nNote:\n\nSee Citation story\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Registries\nAdd a link to your software on a relevant public registry\n\n* For example, the eScience Center maintains the Research Software Directory\n* Can also be domain specific software registries\n* Or even list it on awesomelist\n\nThis aids greatly in Findability by relevant researchers\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n### Software Paper\n\nPublish a journal article about the software specifically\n\n* Journal of Research Software (JORS)\n* Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)\n* SoftwareX\n* CRAN\n\nSome journals perform peer review of the software in question\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Automate as many steps as possible!\n\nFor example, you can automate archiving on Zenodo by linking it to your github account\n\nSee instructions in the \"Automating software publication\" tab of this story\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"}]
