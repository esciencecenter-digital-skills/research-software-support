Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\n- [ ] **Substantial scholarly effort:** Does this submission meet the scope eligibility described in the [JOSS guidelines](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#substantial-scholarly-effort)\n- [ ] **Data sharing:** If the paper contains original data, data are accessible to the reviewers. If the paper contains no original data, please check this item.\n- [ ] **Reproducibility:** If the paper contains original results, results are entirely reproducible by reviewers. If the paper contains no original results, please check this item.\n- [ ] **Human and animal research:** If the paper contains original data research on humans subjects or animals, does it comply with [JOSS's human participants research policy and/or animal research policy](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/policies.html?highlight=animal#joss-policies)? If the paper contains no such data, please check this item.\n\n### Functionality\n\n- [ ] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\n- [ ] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\n- [ ] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] **A statement of need**: Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\n- [ ] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\n- [ ] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\n- [ ] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\n- [ ] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified?\n- [ ] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support.\n\nSkip the last category *Software paper*\n\n## Step 3: How was the reviewing process?\n\nReflect on the difficulty of the review process.\nWhich advantages has this review process?\nAre there projects in which you are currently working that would pass this review?\n"}]
