Depending on the country, protection lasts 50 years or more. The owner of the copyright is the only one who can copy, publish, and modify the software.\n\nIf you make software as part of a job for an employer, then your employer owns the copyright. Otherwise, you are the owner (unless there's a contract somewhere that says otherwise).\n\nThe owner of the copyright on a work can give permission to others to do things they would otherwise not be allowed to do, like copying, publishing and modifying the work. A document that describes what they can do is called a copyright license. These licenses can be given to a specific party, usually as part of a contract, or they can be offered to the general public.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Using others' software\n\n- Two ways of using software\n- You need a license\n- Licenses sometimes implicit, or home-made\n- Open Source is better and safer\n- Different Open Source licenses available\n\n\nNote:\n\nThere are two ways of using someone else's software: running it, and incorporating it into your own program. Both are covered by copyright, because you need to download and because you're making a derivative work.\n\nSo you need copyright permission, which is to say a license. In science, these are sometimes implied, by a researcher publishing the code without an explicit license, or home-made, which is not recommended because a non-expert will overlook many of the details of copyright law.\n\nIt's better if the software has an Open Source license, because these are professionally written and have standard, well-known meanings. We will go into that a bit more later. There are websites available that explain all the standard Open Source licenses in ordinary language, so that you can easily decide whether you can use a certain software package. You don't need to be (or have) a lawyer to use Open Source software.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left\">\n\n## Why share software?\n\n- Reproducibility\n- Increasing impact\n- Academic freedom of employees\n- Saving by collaborating\n- Public funding\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: right\">\n<img src=\"media/Stephanie_Morales_Sharing.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; clear: both; padding-left: 35%; padding-top: 3em\">\n<small>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@stephaniemoarr?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Stephanie Morales</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-white-ceramic-mug-DGt9zA3Fr0g?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></small>\n</div>\n\n\nNote:\n\nScientific software is sometimes shared, but also sometimes kept to themselves by the researchers making it. Here are some reasons that sharing scientific software is important:\n\n- Software is a scientific method, and it must be shared for the science to be reproducible.\n- Sharing software will bring users of the methods and citations to papers about it\n- Researchers frequently change jobs, moving from university to university. Without permission from their previous employers, they would have to start rebuilding their software from scratch every time they move to a new university, which would be very inefficient.\n- Many of the most pressing problems that scientist work on involve complex, multifaceted systems that can only be properly studied in collaboration. Where software is involved, which is to say almost everywhere in academic research, researchers need to be able to exchange software and collaborate on its development, including across projects.\n- The software was most likely funded with public money, and should therefore be available to the public, just like papers are published Open Access.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left\">\n\n## How to share software\n\n- Put it online\n- Add a license\n    1.

This may be very simple but it can also be very complex. More on the next slide.\n\nThe next thing to consider is whether other software has been used in the software you've made (that's almost always the case) and how those so-called dependencies are licensed, as this may constrain your choice.\n\nFinally, different Open Source licenses specify different terms and conditions for use, and you need to decide what you want there.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Who owns a work?\n\n- Work for hire\n- Consortium agreements\n- Funding constraints\n\n\nNote:\n\nIn most countries, including The Netherlands, any work you do as part of your tasks as an employee of an organisation belongs to your employer, not to you. After all, they're paying you to do the work. This means that the copyright on any software written by a university employee is owned by the university.\n\nScience is often done in consortia, which are typically governed by a Consortium Agreement. Those often have a section on Intellectual Property that applies. Sadly those sections often don't mention copyright, but they do usually state that each partner gets to own the things they've made. That means that if your researcher has worked together on the software with researcher at one of the partners, that there are two owners that need to decide on licensing together.\n\nFunding may also come with restrictions or stipulations regarding ownership. For example, eScience Center grants come with a rule that says that both parties co-own the software, even if it was written by one of them, and that it will be published under the Apache License unless otherwise agreed.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Kinds of licenses\n\n<table style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\">\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n        <th colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Free and Open Source</th>\n        <th rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Proprietary</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n        <th colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Copyleft</th>\n        <th rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Permissive</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n        <th align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Strong</th>\n        <th align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">Weak</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black\">\n      <td align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; padding: 1em\">GPL<sup>1</sup> AGPL<sup>2</sup></td>\n      <td align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; padding: 1em\">LGPL<sup>3</sup> MPL<sup>4</sup></td>\n      <td align=\"center\" style=\"border: 0.1em solid black; padding: 1em\">BSD<sup>5</sup> MIT<sup>6</sup> Apache</td>\n          <td align=\"center\" >Research only, No&nbsp;copying, No&nbsp;modification</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 1em; font-size: 70%; line-height: 2em\">\n  <sup>1</sup>GPL: GNU General Public License <sup>2</sup>AGPL: Affero General Public License <sup>3</sup>LGPL: GNU Lesser General Public License <sup>4</sup>MPL: Mozilla Public License <sup>5</sup>BSD: Berkeley Software Distribution <sup>6</sup>MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n</div>\n\n\nNote:\n\nSoftware licenses can be classified into different categories, which is helpful to get a quick idea for what kind of license you are dealing with. First, there are Open Source and non-Open Source licenses. Open Source licenses allow you to use the software, share it, change it, and share your changes. Proprietary software licenses do not allow one or more of these things. Note that this is not about being commercial, you can actually sell copies of Open Source programs, although you're not very likely to find buyers.\n\nCopyleft licenses say that if you modify the licensed software or incorporate it into your own, that that new software package must then be licensed under the same license. A permissive license allows licensing the new work under any license. As a result, copyleft software needs to remain open source, while permissively licensed software can be made proprietary.\n\nWithin the copyleft licenses we can distinguish strong copyleft, which covers both modified versions and use in other programs, from weak copyleft, which only limits modification. So a weak copyleft license keeps the licensed software package itself Open Source, but can be used as a part of proprietary software, while a strong copyleft license keeps the software from being used in (but not with) proprietary software (it is a bit vague legally where the limit is).\n\nFinally, the Affero GPL is designed for use with software that is designed to be installed on a server and accessed remotely, for example through a web browser. A normal copyleft license does not require the server owner to give a copy of the software running on the server to the users, while the AGPL does.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Choosing a license\n\n- Use a standard Open Source license\n- Check your policy (if applicable)\n- Use a tool\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe next step is to choose a license. If at all possible, use a standard Open Source license, because it will make everyone's lives much easier. Do not use Creative Commons licenses, as they're not designed for use with software.\n\nNext, check if your organisation has a policy that covers software licenses. Those are still a bit rare, but they're being worked on in many places so it's likely that you'll have one at some point. Check whether it specifies a particular license, or maybe a range of acceptable ones.\n\nFinally, there are some nice tools available that make it easier to select an Open Source license. We'll have a look at that in the exercise.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left\">\n\n## Contributing to software\n\n- Under the license\n- Contributor License Agreements\n    - Who are you dealing with?\n    - Transfer or license?\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right\">\n<img src=\"media/Kleine_Dinge.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; clear: both; padding-left: 35%; padding-top: 3em\">\n<small>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markkoenig?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Mark König</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-green-quote-board-xCEuxxhpY3o?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></small>\n</div>\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe most common way of contributing to an open source project is to do it under the license associated with the project. That means that you keep the copyright on your addition or modification, and license it under the same license as the existing code. This is the norm for small projects run by volunteers (or scientists). This case is similar to sharing your own code under a given license.\n\nLarger, more professionally run Open Source projects sometimes require a Contributor License Agreement. This is a contract that states what the recipient of your improvement can do with it. These are not standardised, so the contents vary.\n\nWhen evaluating these, it's good to look at who you're dealing with. A commercial entity, like Google, or a governance organisation like the Apache Foundation. The latter non-profit offers support for Open Source projects, including making sure that everything is properly licensed. Google is of course a commercial entity.\n\nSome CLAs require you to transfer ownership of the copyright on your contribution to someone else, which can be a good idea if that sole copyright holder can be trusted, for example because it makes it easier to upgrade the license. It may also allow them to turn your work proprietary however. In other cases, you're just giving explicit permission to distribute your contribution as Open Source software, which seems more just.\n\nIn general with CLAs, you should be careful with commercial entities (state aid!), and it's in any case probably wise to get your legal department involved.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/licenses/copyright","_dir":"licenses","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Copyright","description":"","type":"reading","order":2,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"copyright-and-software-2-minutes"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Copyright and software (2 minutes)"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Creative works, like books, paintings and music, but also scientific articles and software, are covered by copyright.

By copyright law, only the copyright owner(s) can give this permission, so the license must be granted by those owners.\n\nThere are different kinds of software licenses, with different underlying business models. Some software producers sell copies or seats, where the user has to pay for each computer that the software is used on or person the software is used by, and where the user does not have permission to modify or distribute the software. In this case, licenses are given to individual users or companies as part of a sales contract.\n\nIt is also possible to make a general statement that anyone can use, modify and/or distribute a software package under certain conditions. In this case, there is no contract, and no specific counterparty. Instead, the owners of the copyright give the same permissions to everyone, usually in a document included with the software as it is put on the Internet. Software distributed like this can usually be downloaded without paying, although there may still be significant limitations on what you can do with it.\n\nSome software is distributed with a license that gives very broad permissions to anyone who obtains a copy. Such software is known as Free Software and/or Open Source Software. Before we look at what that is exactly, it helps to understand a bit better what software actually is, and how it's made.\n\n### What is software?\n\nTo non-programmers, software can appear to be a somewhat magical thing. It is in our computers and phones and it makes them work, or sometimes not work. It's made by specialist people who we call programmers, and who must be very smart to be able to make all this work, or perhaps very dumb given how often software doesn't work. In short, it seems to be mysterious.\n\nOf course, programmers are perfectly ordinary people. They make the software that makes our phones and computers work, and sometimes programmers make mistakes, and then the software doesn't work as intended. Computer programs are made by typing text into the computer, just like you do when writing an email or a letter. Computer programs consist of one or more files with instructions for the computer. These files can be modified to change what the software does, they can be combined together into a larger, more complex program, and they can be shared with others and reused. For the computer to be able to run the software, the files need to be translated from the human-readable text form (the *source code*) into a sequence of numbers encoding the same commands (a *binary*). This is done mechanically by a special program called a compiler or an interpreter.\n\nThere are different ways of making software collaboratively. One is to work closely together (even sharing a computer!) on the same source code, which can help reduce mistakes as two see more than one, or it can be useful as a teaching exercise. Looser ways of collaborating include copying someone else's code and then independently modifying it to do something a bit different, and reusing a software component made by someone else in your own program, usually in its original form but possibly with changes as well.\n\nThe looser forms of collaboration rely on software being distributed from its maker to its user, who then modifies it or integrates it. This requires permission from the copyright owners because there's distribution and the creation of a derivative work, which means that there needs to be a license. A reliable and easy way to do this is to make all the software Free and Open Source.\n\n### Free and Open Source Software\n\nThe Free Software Foundation lists four freedoms that users need to be given by the copyright owner(s) for a program to be considered Free Software:\n\n- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.\n- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it, so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.\n- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code a precondition for this.\n\nNote that the word \"free\" here refers to freedom to do things, not to what the software costs. You're allowed to sell copies of Free Software!\n\nOpen Source Software has an official definition too, which is quite a bit longer but boils down to the same thing. Because of that, the terms are often combined into Free and Open Source Software, or FOSS, but the term Open Source is also popular. We will use them here interchangeably.\n\nYou can make a software package that you own the copyright to Open Source by distributing it (usually on the Internet) under an Open Source license, i.e. one that gives everyone the above freedoms. In practice, that means that the software is distributed in source code form, with a license document stating that the copyright owners give everyone the freedom to do the above things, subject to certain conditions. There exist a small number of standard Open Source licenses that you can use. All of these are open source, but there are some difference as well that are good to know about.\n\n### License categories\n\n<table>\n    <tr align=\"center\">\n        <th colspan=\"3\">Free and Open Source</th>\n        <th rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\">Proprietary</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\">\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Copyleft</th>\n        <th rowspan=\"2\">Permissive</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\">\n        <th>Strong</th>\n        <th>Weak</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr align=\"center\">\n      <td>GPL<sup>1</sup> AGPL<sup>2</sup></td>\n      <td>LGPL<sup>3</sup> MPL<sup>4</sup></td>\n      <td>BSD<sup>5</sup> MIT<sup>6</sup> Apache</td>\n          <td>Research Only: No&nbsp;copying, No&nbsp;modification</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n  <sup>1</sup>GPL: GNU General Public License <sup>2</sup>AGPL: Affero General Public License <sup>3</sup>LGPL: GNU Lesser General Public License <sup>4</sup> MPL: Mozilla Public License <sup>5</sup> BSD: Berkeley Software Distribution <sup>6</sup> MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n</div>\n\nThe table above shows five of the most common FOSS licenses. They're organised in a hierarchystarting with the distinction between Free and Open Source on the one and, and proprietary software on the other. Proprietary software is software that isn't FOSS, which is to say that it has restrictions on use or modification or distribution.

For Open Source this is not the case: there is a copyright and it's owned by someone, but the license gives everyone else the same permissions they have and so they don't have exclusive control.\n\nWithin the category of Open Source licenses, we can distinguish Copyleft licenses and Permissive licenses.

In particular, permissive licenses allow the software to be used as a part of non-Open Source software, and for it to be redistributed without the source code, so that it cannot be inspected or modified anymore.\n\nCopyleft licenses try to ensure that the software remains FOSS.

This section explains the main issues to take into account, which are ownership of the copyright, constraints imposed by dependencies, and choosing a license.\n\n### Ownership\n\nA copyright license must be given by the owner(s) of the copyright being licensed. This means that the first step to licensing a program is to find those owners. In most countries, including The Netherlands, any work you do as part of your tasks as an employee of an organisation belongs to your employer, not to you. After all, they're paying you to do the work. This means that the copyright on any software written by a university employee is owned by the university.\n\nIf the software to be shared is written entirely by one person, with no copy-pasting of code from others, and no help from people outside of the organisation, then the copyright is therefore owned by your organisation, and it can decide how to license the code.\n\nScience is often done collaboratively though, and that makes things a bit more complicated. Funding for research is often given to consortia comprising multiple organisations that will collaboratively execute the research project. Such a consortium is governed by a Consortium Agreement (CA), which almost always has an Intellectual Property paragraph. Unfortunately, the standard text in the templates used for those documents rarely mentions software, as it mainly addresses patents and trade secrets. It does however usually say that each party gets to own the things they make, and that the partners can use it for the purpose of executing the research, but not beyond that. (Note that there is always some negotiation regarding the text, so you should check any specific CAs that apply, and not rely on this general description.)\n\nFunding may also come with terms covering ownership. eScience Center grants for example come with a stipulation that both parties co-own the software even if it is written completely by one of the partners.\n\nSo, if your researcher works on the software together with a researcher from a different organisation, then both organisations need to agree to license their respective copyrights, ideally under the same license to avoid complicating things.\n\nFor long-lived scientific software that isn't Open Source already, it can sometimes be very difficult to determine ownership. It may not always be clear who wrote which part of the code (especially if no version control software was used), who they worked for when they did so, and which contracts were in place that governed their activities. Ideally, the copyright owners would have been carefully tracked over the life of the software, with copyright statements in the README documenting the owners. That is unfortunately very rare however. If it is not possible to determine the owners of the copyright, then the software cannot be licensed.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nOwners may not be completely free to decide how to license their software. Aside from any constraints imposed by funders, *dependencies* play a role. Dependencies are externally developed, separate software packages that are needed for the software to work. Having such dependencies is very common, and dependencies typically have their own dependencies, so that any complete computer program consists of a whole collection of software packages, usually written by different people. These days at least for Open Source software, the complete program is rarely distributed as a whole. Instead, the owners of the individual components each put their components online, and a special tool is used to collect all the required bits and combine them together on the computer of the user, who can then use the software.\n\nAs described in the section on licensing, strong copyleft licenses place constraints on how the combined software can be licensed. As a result, you cannot use them in a non-Open Source program. This does not mean that you have to make your software Open Source if has a copyleft dependency, but *if* you distribute it, then that must be done under the same license, and/or a more permissive one that does not conflict with it.\n\nAs you can see, dependencies with strong copyleft licenses can make life a bit more complicated. On the other hand, as long as no proprietary software is involved not much can go wrong. In case there are proprietary dependencies (including ones without a license, or \"academic use only\" or somesuch), there is a larger issue. If the software cannot work without the dependency, and the proprietary license does not allow redistribution, there we can still open source the software, but others won't be able to run it unless they can somehow get a copy of the proprietary dependency. And if you choose a strong copyleft license for your code, then you'll have to add a special exception for your users to be able to use it with the proprietary dependency.\n\nSo it is really proprietary software that complicates things legally, and that's aside from the lack of Open Science transparency. On the other hand, some proprietary software package is sometimes the only solution, and so proprietary dependencies cannot always be avoided. If that's the case, you'll have to look at the specific terms for that package and try to find a solution.\n\nWeak copyleft licenses are less of an issue, because they do not reach beyond the licensed package itself. They can become an issue if your researcher has copy-pasted code from them into their own program (which is bad practice, but unfortunately fairly common still), or created a modified version. In that case the same weak copyleft license applies to (parts of) their code or the modified software, thus restricting the available license choices.\n\n### Choosing a license\n\nIn almost all cases, scientific software should be licensed under a common, standard Open Source license. Open Source enables scientific collaboration and makes the work available to the society that paid for its creation, and not using a standard license creates enough legal risk that most potential users will not be willing to touch the software unless they really have to.\n\nWhether to use a permissive, weak, or strong copyleft license is up to the copyright owner. If your organisation has a policy on software, then it may well say something about which licenses can be used, so be sure to check that. The authors of the software may also have an opinion, or develop one if you explain the different kinds of licenses to them. A tool like [ChooseALicense](https://www.choosealicense.com) may help here.\n\nNote that Creative Commons licenses should not be used for software. They were created specifically to be able to apply the concept of Open Source to everything that is *not* software, and aren't suitable to the specific properties of software. So use CC for data and other works, and an Open Source license for software.\n\n"},{"_path":"/modules/licenses/ex_choose_a_license","_dir":"licenses","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Choose a license","description":"","type":"exercise","order":6,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"exercise-2-choose-a-license-for-or-using-your-policy-10-minutes"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Exercise 2: Choose a license for or using your policy (10 minutes)"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One of the concerns typically addressed in a software policy is licensing of software developed at the institution.
