in science. A first thought may be its role in data collection and analysis. Further, it may play a role in designing experiments, based on models generated. It may _be_ the experiment itself, simulate a research outcome based on data or ideas entered; it may also be the \"brain\" behind controlling crucial instrumentation.\n\nWhat scientific software can you think of?\n\nWhat role does it play?\n\nAn example here: the Event Horizon Telescope, which took a \"picture\" of a black hole.\nThe \"telescope\" is not a single tool, but complex: a \"planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes\" (wikipedia).\nThe separate telescopes collect data that is synchronized with atomic clocks, and the data is combined at highly specialised supercomputers.\nThe data can be converted into an image using custom software.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"media/definition.png\" width=\"55%\">\n</center>\n\n<small>definition of Research Software from the FAIR4RS working group</small>\n\nNote:\n\nA definition of research software, from the FAIR4RS working group.\nIt is important that not all software that is used in research is research software.\nFor example, a text editor that is used to write a paper is not research software.\nNor is powerpoint, a web browser, or the software used to guide the telescope.\nEven tools like R or Python are not necessarily research software.\nThe code written in R or Python for an analysis would be research software, however.\nJust like a custom-made Excel macro that is used to analyse data.\nOr a custom-made web application that is used to collect data.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"media/unescoopenscience.png\" width=\"50%\">\n</center>\n\n<small>[UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, 2021](https://creativecommons.org/2021/12/02/unesco-recommendation-on-open-science-ratified/) (CC BY IGO 3.0)</small>\n\nNote:\nOpen Science encompasses many aspects of science.\nIt is a movement that aims to make science — which includes software — more open, transparent, and accessible.\nThis is supported by many organisations, including UNESCO.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## The FAIR principles\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"media/fair.png\" width=\"60%\">\n</center>\n\nNote:\nthe FAIR principles standardize values that help openness, transparency, and accessibility.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n![screenshot Wilkinson 2016](media/fairwilkinson.png)\n\nNote:\nFAIR principles were originally designed for data, but are also applicable to software.\nDesigned also with other digital objects in mind, though actual description was data-specific.\nThis has been extended meanwhile.\n\n===\n\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software is not data\n\nSoftware is...\n\n- **complex**: code is creatively generated, interconnected and multi-layered\n- **interdependent**: it builds upon and therefore depends on other software\n- **executable**: it is not static, but can be run\n- **dynamic**: it can break over time, and versioning is common\n\nNote:\nWhile technically, software is a special kind of data (in that it is representation of information in a digital state), they are in essence quite different.\n\nSoftware and data both are digital objects, sharing certain characteristics: they can be assigned a DOI, and they can have a license.\n\nSoftware is quite different from data, however. Consider:\n\n- Complexity; it is not a single file, but a collection of files that are interconnected and multi-layered, and do not necessarily stand on their own. Software is also the result of a creative process that provides a tool to do something, and not the result of a measurement or observation.\n- Interdependence; software is often built using other software, and rarely built completely from scratch. This makes it dependent on other existing applications, which themselves may also change over time.\n- Executability; software is in its dryest form a set of instructions that can be an archive of a procedure. However, the main goal of software is that these instructions can be executed. Data, by contrast, stand on their own.\n- Dynamic vs static; its interdependence and context-dependency drives software to require maintenance to retain its value, and this maintenance is not straightforward. Maintenance is also counter to academic culture; it does not fit in existing structures (both in terms of reward/recognition, but also in terms of funding and understanding of what is needed). Versioning of software is very common, while data is often static (though versions may happen).\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software opportunities\n\n- Software is a **living thing**\n- Creative process allows for **early adoption** of good practices\n- Openness and transparency are **inherent** to software\n\n\nNote:\nThe different nature of software also provides opportunities.\nSoftware is a living thing, and therefore it is easier to adopt good practices early on.\nCrucially, there is a community driven openness in software that long predates the open science movement.\nThis is not to say that software is inherently open, but that there is a broad open culture, which also comes with existing tools and pathways to facilitate openness and transparency.\nConsider GitHub (and other code hosting platforms), which are designed for this purpose.\nConsider also version control software, a good software development practice that builds in provenance.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n![FAIR for Research Software paper](media/fair4rs_paper.png)\n\nFair 4 Research Software (FAIR4RS) working group (2022)\n[doi:10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)\n\n![Contributing Organizations](media/fair4rs_logos.png)\n\nNote:\nIn 2022, the results of extensive community consultation were published in the FAIR for Research Software paper.\nThe group behind this was a collaboration between the Research Software Alliance, the Research Data Alliance, and FORCE11.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n![FAIR for Research Software principles](media/fair4rs_principles.png)\n\nNote:\nThese are the interpretations given to the FAIR principles for software by the working group.\nIn many cases these are rephrased to better fit software, but in some cases they are also extended.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Findability\n\n![FAIR4RS Findability](media/fair4rs_F.png)\n\n- Archive on Zenodo for DOI and persistence<br />\n  <small> Note that persistence on GitHub is not guaranteed!</small>\n- Use (semantic) versioning with updates<br />\n  <small> Zenodo assigns a DOI to each version </small>\n- Include metadata, explicitly containing the DOI<br />\n  <small> but also license, version, dependencies, etc. </small>\n- Register the software in a community registry<br />\n  <small> such as PyPI or CRAN, depending on the language/domain </small>\n\nNote:\nFor software findability, a few things need to work together:\n\nThe software needs to be archived on a platform that provides a DOI and persistence. GitHub is not guaranteed to provide this, and while it is a useful tool is not a suitable archive for software.\nGitHub does work well together with Zenodo, which provides both.\nTogether they also provide functionality for versioning: when releasing a new version on GitHub, and using the Zenodo integration, Zenodo will update the entry and assign a new DOI to the new version.\n\nFor software-specific findability, though, Zenodo is insufficient. Here, you can think of more specific registries, such as PyPI, CRAN, or Bioconductor; depending on the language and domain of the software.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Accessibility\n\n![FAIR4RS Accessibility](media/fair4rs_A.png)\n\n- Community registries provide standard download protocols<br />\n  <small> e.g. `pip install my_software` </small>\n- Metadata on Zenodo is part of the persistent archive\n\nNote:\nA lot of accessibility is covered by the findability principles, but there are a few additional things to consider.\nSpecifically, software may still be FAIR as long as its metadata is accessible.\nThe code of the software itself, not the actual functional engine, could be considered metadata.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Interoperability\n\n![FAIR4RS Interoperability](media/fair4rs_I.png)\n\n- Input and output both needs to meet community standards<br />\n  <small> e.g. file formats, data models, ontologies </small>\n- References to external objects should be unambiguous<br />\n  <small> use URLs, DOIs, version numbers etc. </small>\n\nNote:\nAs with data, interoperability refers partly to formats and standards (in this case: inputs, outputs, or other objects used). For example CSV, JSON, and XML are interoperable formats, while PDF is not.\nThese standards may also be domain-specific, such as the use of ontologies in the life sciences.\n\nThe second sub-principle refers to the use of unambiguous references to external objects, such as libraries, data, or models. A clear link allows the right object to be used by the software.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Reusability\n\n![FAIR4RS Reusability](media/fair4rs_R.png)\n\n- Include a software-specific license<br />\n  <small>as a file called `LICENSE` in the project's root</small>\n- Many Open Source software licenses exist<br />\n  <small> see [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)</small>\n- License choice is not always straightforward<br />\n  <small> confirm with dependencies, copyright holder(s), and specialists </small>\n- Use version control (e.g. Git) with a public host (e.g. GitHub)<br />\n  <small> history and provenance is a public part of the repository </small>\n- Dependencies should be listed, and unambiguous<br />\n  <small> use a standardized file/protocol, and version numbers</small>\n\nNote:\nLicenses are an important part of reusability.\nWithout a license, copyright disallows reuse.\nIn an open science context especially, Open Source licenses are the default choice.\nThey are numerous, but the choice is not always straightforward.\nIt is advised to learn about the different licenses, about important considerations (e.g. dependencies and the role and identity of copyright holders) and to consult with specialists when in doubt.\n\n===\n\n### FAIR is not a quality checklist\n\nSoftware quality is addressed insofar as it affects:\n\n- usability, an aspect of interoperability\n- maintainability, an important element of reuse\n\nQuality aspects *not* part of FAIR:\n\n- computational efficiency &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- functional correctness\n- security\n- ...\n\nNote:\nThe FAIR principles are limited in scope when it comes to software.\nIt is important to realize that their primary goal is not to address software quality itself.\nFAIR software can be of poor quality, and good quality software may not be FAIR.\n\nSome quality aspects are addressed by FAIR, in particular usability and maintainability.\nBecause software is dynamic and interdependent, its reusability requires that it is maintained to continue to work (or that a conserved context is provided, such as a virtual machine with required dependencies).\n\nSecondary to maintainability are quality aspects like tests, modularized architecture, developer documentation, and so on.\n\nInteroperable software is usable by others, and therefore it is important that it is well documented and that it is easy to install and run.\nThis ties into quality aspects like user documentation, installation instructions, and so on.\n\nNote though, that there is no mention of correctness, nor of efficiency or security.\nSoftware may adhere perfectly to FAIR, yet produce the wrong results, in a painfully slow and inefficient process, while leaking personal information.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## FAIR is a spectrum\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"media/spectrum.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n</center>\n\nNote:\n\nFAIR is not a checklist, but a set of principles.\nAs such, it informs a spectrum of software sustainability, and not a binary \"FAIR or not FAIR\".\n\nFAIR is not a perfect metric, but it is helpful, and tailored to specific values of open science.\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Take home messages\n\n- Software is an important part of research\n- FAIR4RS principles guide towards accessibility and openness of research software\n- FAIR is not a quality checklist\n- Software places unique demands on FAIR, and provides unique opportunities\n- FAIRness is a spectrum\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47

Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.\n  - F1.1. Components of the software representing levels of granularity are assigned distinct identifiers.\n  - F1.2. Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers.\n- F2. Software is described with rich metadata.\n- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe.\n- F4. Metadata are FAIR, searchable and indexable.\n\n#### A: Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardised protocols.\n\n- A1. Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardised communications protocol.\n  - A1.1. The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.\n  - A1.2. The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.\n- A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available.\n\n#### I: Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards.\n\n- I1. Software reads, writes and exchanges data in a way that meets domain-relevant community standards.\n- I2. Software includes qualified references to other objects.\n\n#### R: Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).\n\n- R1. Software is described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.\n  - R1.1. Software is given a clear and accessible license.\n  - R1.2. Software is associated with detailed provenance.\n- R2. Software includes qualified references to other software.\n- R3. Software meets domain-relevant community standards.\n\n### Three examples\n\nThe following three examples of software have been described with statements that can be mapped to the FAIR4RS Principles. With each statement, identify the principle(s) it maps to, and the (sub)facet(s) of the principle(s) it addresses. A single statement may map to multiple (sub)facets.\n\n#### Example 1: [Comet](https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201200439)\n\n[Comet](https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201200439) is a command-line tool and desktop application for tandem mass spectrometry sequence database search6.\n\n- Comet is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source licence.\n- Comet is registered in the bio.tools catalogue of bioinformatics tools, where it has a globally unique and persistent identifier, and rich metadata that includes the identifier and is searchable and indexable.\n- The metadata in bio.tools is independent from the Comet repository, and will stay accessible should the software itself become inaccessible.\n- The publicly accessible project repository on GitHub includes detailed information about the development of Comet.\n- The code includes dependencies to external software packages, such as Thermo Scientific’s MSFileReader library.\n- Comet can be downloaded via the browser following the links provided in the metadata using https.\n- Comet uses standard data types from the proteomics domain for its input and output data that are documented in the metadata as functional annotations.\n\n#### Example 2: [PureGoMe](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4337242)\n\n[PureGoMe](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4337242) is a project aimed at understanding Dutch public sentiment during the COVID-19 outbreak period by analysing real-time Twitter data. It provides a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for this purpose.\n\n- PureGoMe can be downloaded from the project repository, while metadata is accessible independently from the registry.\n- PuReGoMe's GitHub repository has detailed records of the development history.\n- The code includes dependencies to other software, such as various Python libraries.\n- PuReGoMe has a (versioned) DOI from Zenodo.\n- PuReGoMe uses the Apache 2.0 open source licence.\n- PuReGoMe uses standard file formats (e.g., CSV files) for data exchange.\n- PuReGoMe refers to other objects such as websites.\n- PureGoMe is registered in the Research Software Directory that captures the most relevant metadata, including the identifier, in searchable and indexable form.\n\n#### Example 3: [gammaShiny](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4139005)\n\n[gammaShiny](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4139005) is an application that provides enhanced graphical user interfaces for the R gamma package8. It is used to process in-situ gamma-ray spectrometry measurements for luminescence dating.\n\n- gammaShiny has been deposited in the HAL French national archive and it has a persistent globally unique identifier, with the HAL identifier of the metadata record and a SWHID, identifying specifically the software artefact on the Software Heritage universal software source code archive.\n- Thanks to the HAL platform, where a licence is mandatory, gammaShiny is under a GNU General Public Licence v3.0.\n- The archived versions of gammaShiny’s source code in Software Heritage include a codemeta.json file, identifiable with a SWHID, where other metadata is available including dependencies named in CodeMeta (\"softwareRequirements\").\n\n### Do you agree?\n\nThe examples were taken from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x).\nIn the Results section of the paper you will find the authors' analysis of the software, which contains the statements above, mapped to the FAIR4RS Principles.\n\nDo you agree with their assessment?"},{"_path":"/modules/fairsoftware/exercise3","_dir":"fairsoftware","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"FAIR in practice","description":"","type":"exercise","order":4,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"exercise-fair-in-practice"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Exercise: FAIR in practice"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Role playing exercise:\nOne person presents the software, the other person gives feedback."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tasks for presenter:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is the software about?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Who will use it?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is the expected lifecycle of the software?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What potential users or applications are untapped?"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tasks for reviewer:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Which FAIR principles are addressed?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How can the software be made more FAIR?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What would be the next step (low-hanging fruit)?"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Together:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Define the next steps for the software"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Goals:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Frame an assessment positively: always start with assessing the things that have been done that contribute to good management and FAIR software.
