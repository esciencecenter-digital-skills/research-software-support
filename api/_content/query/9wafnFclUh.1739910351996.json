After each integration, a working version of the project is built, and the software's test suite is run automatically. This process allows for the early identification of defects, errors, flaws, or bugs introduced by changes, helping to maintain code quality and reduce the chances of major issues when combining everyone's work.\n\n### Importance of CI\nCI offers several key benefits:\n\n- **Early Bug Detection**: By identifying bugs early, CI minimizes their impact and makes them easier to fix.\n- **Synchronization**: Keeps project contributors up to date with each otherâ€™s work, allowing them to benefit from new features as soon as possible.\n- **Encouragement to Write Tests**: Promotes the practice of writing tests, ensuring better code quality.\n- **Test Automation**: Automates the process of running tests, saving time and effort.\n- **Frequent Testing**: Ensures that tests are run frequently, maintaining continuous validation of the software's functionality.\n\n## Continuous Deployment (CD) (1 minute)\nContinuous Deployment (CD) is an extension of the CI practice that automates the release of software updates to users. This is done for every change that passes all stages of the development pipeline, including automated tests. CD ensures that the software is always in a releasable state and that new features, improvements, and bug fixes are delivered to users quickly and consistently.\n\nTogether, CI and CD form a powerful combination that enhances the efficiency, reliability, and speed of the software development process.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/testing","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Testing","description":"A cut-out of the following image:","category":"Developing Software","order":4,"abstract":"Local testing of your software and using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)","author":"eScience Center","thumbnail":"thumbnail-testing.jpg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:testing:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/testing/index.md","_stem":"modules/testing/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Software Testing\ncategory: Developing Software\norder: 4\nabstract: Local testing of your software and using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\nauthor: eScience Center\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-testing.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\nA cut-out of the following image:\n\nCrash test dummy in a 2010 Hyundai Tucson GLS at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Vehicle Research Center.\nThis file is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en) license.\n[thumbnail-testing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IIHS_crash_test_dummy_in_Hyundai_Tucson.jpg)\nPhoto by Brady Holt"}]
