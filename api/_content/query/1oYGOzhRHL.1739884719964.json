One aspect to consider would be its license, if there is one.\n\nPick a software package from the following list, and try to find out whether it has a license and if so which. The idea is to cover the list together, so let's not all start at the top!\n\n- Kernel Tuner\n- nodal-dg\n- OpenFOAM\n- MATLAB\n- COPASI\n- Glotaran\n- LinkAhead\n\nA few hints:\n\n- The researcher only gave you the name. You'll have to find the code on the Internet first.\n- Licenses are not always advertised on a code's website. Try looking somewhere more technical if you can't find it in the documentation.\n\n## Exercise 2: What advice would you give?\n"},{"_path":"/modules/licenses","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Licenses","description":"thumbnail-licenses","category":"Sharing Software","order":1,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":"What are software licenses, copyright and open-source, how are they related and why is it important to think about?","thumbnail":"thumbnail-licenses.png","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:licenses:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/licenses/index.md","_stem":"modules/licenses/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Software Licenses\ncategory: Sharing Software\norder: 1\nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: What are software licenses, copyright and open-source, how are they related and why is it important to think about?\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-licenses.png\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n[thumbnail-licenses](https://unsplash.com/photos/laptop-compute-displaying-command-prompt-vII7qKAk-9A?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@disruptxn?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Desola Lanre-Ologun</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/laptop-compute-displaying-command-prompt-vII7qKAk-9A?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>\n\n"}]
