Consider:\n\n- Complexity; it is not a single file, but a collection of files that are interconnected and multi-layered, and do not necessarily stand on their own. Software is also the result of a creative process that provides a tool to do something, and not the result of a measurement or observation.\n- Interdependence; software is often built using other software, and rarely built completely from scratch. This makes it dependent on other existing applications, which themselves may also change over time.\n- Executability; software is in its dryest form a set of instructions that can be an archive of a procedure. However, the main goal of software is that these instructions can be executed. Data, by contrast, stand on their own.\n- Dynamic vs static; its interdependence and context-dependency drives software to require maintenance to retain its value, and this maintenance is not straightforward. Maintenance is also counter to academic culture; it does not fit in existing structures (both in terms of reward/recognition, but also in terms of funding and understanding of what is needed). Versioning of software is very common, while data is often static (though versions may happen).\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Software vs data management\n\n- Software is a **living thing**\n- Some FAIR data management practices apply to software\n- Many FAIR principles do not apply easily to software\n- Good data management will not ensure good software management\n\nNote:\nThe different nature of software also provides opportunities but also requires extra thought on its management.\nSoftware is a living thing, and therefore it is easier to adopt good practices early on.\nCrucially, there is a community driven openness in software that long predates the open science movement.\nThis is not to say that software is inherently open, but that there is a broad open culture, which also comes with existing tools and pathways to facilitate openness and transparency.\nConsider GitHub (and other code hosting platforms), which are designed for this purpose.\nConsider also version control software, a good software development practice that builds in provenance.\n\n===\n\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Take home messages\n\n- Software is a special kind of data\n- Some FAIR data management \n- Wee need extra and different techniques for software management\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"},{"_path":"/modules/softwaremanagementplans","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Management Plans","description":"thumbnail-smp","id":1,"trl":"medium","category":"Reusability","author":"eScience Center","thumbnail":"thumbnail-smp.jpg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:softwaremanagementplans:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/softwaremanagementplans/index.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\nid: 1\ntrl: medium\ncategory: Reusability\ntitle: Software Management Plans\nauthor: eScience Center\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-smp.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n[thumbnail-smp](https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-pencil-near-laptop-computer-5fNmWej4tAA?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@homajob?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Scott Graham</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-pencil-near-laptop-computer-5fNmWej4tAA?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>"}]
