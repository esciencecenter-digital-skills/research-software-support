They make the software that makes our phones and computers work, and sometimes programmers make mistakes, and then the software doesn't work as intended.

These files can be modified to change what the software does, they can be combined together into a larger, more complex program, and they can be shared with others and reused. For the computer to be able to run the software, the files need to be translated from the human-readable text form (the "},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"source code"}]},{"type":"text","value":") into a sequence of numbers encoding the same commands (a "},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"binary"}]},{"type":"text","value":").

It's called proprietary because there is a proprietor or (copyright) owner, who has exclusive control over the software.

They envision a world in which computer users collaboratively develop the software they use, sharing their improvements with each other. They therefore prefer copyleft licenses, because those ensure that as many software packages (and therefore, users) as possible are free."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Open Source takes a more pragmatic approach in assuming that most software is made by a small cadre of software developers, often employed by companies, and that there are a potentially large number of end users that have neither the skills nor the inclination to change what their computer does.
