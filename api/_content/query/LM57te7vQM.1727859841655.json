This whole collection needs to be reproduced on the computer of the user for things to work. There are two ways of doing that: 1) combining them all together on the computer of the developer, and then wrapping everything up into a package, installer, container image, or VM image that is sent to the user, or 2) putting the components that you made yourself on the Internet (as a package), and relying on the user to download the other components (packages) and assembling it all together into a working application.\n\n## Monolithic applications\n\nOption 1) works for applications, which are more or less independent. If they're used together, then it's by saving a file from one and opening it in another application. Each application contains all the bits it needs, and is installed on the user's computer in a separate folder, away from everything else. That means that different applications don't get in each other's way, but it's also rather inefficient if many applications use the same component, because you end up with many copies of that component.\n\nIf you do choose option 1), then you still have a choice between making a package, an installer, a container image, or a virtual machine image. A package is an archive (think a ZIP-file, which it often literally is) that contains, in this case, all the components needed by the application. Since it's just a file, a package needs to be installed by a special program called a package manager. The App Store or Play Store on your phone is such a program.\n\nAn installer is itself a computer program, that also contains all the components needed by the application. It gets downloaded by the user, who then runs it, after which it copies all the components from within itself onto the user's computer. It can then run there just like an application installed from a package using a package manager.\n\nA container image is a special kind of package. It also contains all the parts needed to run a program, but it is run in a special isolated environment called a container. A normal application can access everything else on the computer, including files and parts of other applications. It's set up to use its own components of course, but it could access other things if it wanted or needed to. An application that runs in a container can't do this, it's isolated from everything else except for the operating system.

It contains its own operating system together with the application, so that the running application cannot even access the operating system on the user's computer. This has similar advantages as a container, being more secure, but it's also slower than using containers.\n\nSo these are the different ways option 1), distributing a monolithic application with everything included, can be implemented. As said, this reduces potential compatibility problems, but isn't very efficient because you end up with many copies of everything.\n\n## Separate packages\n\nOption 2) is more efficient than option 1), because the user can just install each component once, and then every other component that needs it can use it. There are drawbacks here as well though. First, the user needs to figure out which components are needed for a particular application, and then install them one by one.
