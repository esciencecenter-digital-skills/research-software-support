In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software.\n\n## Teaching this lesson?\nDo you want to teach Research Software Support? This material is open-source and freely available. \nAre you planning on using our material in your teaching? \nWe would love to help you prepare to teach the lesson and receive feedback on how it could be further improved, based on your experience in the workshop.\n\nYou can notify us that you plan to teach this lesson by creating an issue in this repository. Also, it would be great if you can update [this overview of all workshops taught with this lesson material](workshops.md). This helps us show the impact of developing open-source lessons to our funders.\n\n## Target audience\nThe target audience for this material is University management and support staff. University management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software. The University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions to the content of the Research Software Support platform. Please view [the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Technical documentation\nThis platform uses the [NEBULA framework](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA).\n\nFor elaborate setup instructions and other documentation, see the [NEBULA documentation](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs)\n\n## Quick local setup\n\nMore detailed information about local setup can be found in the [NEBULA local rendering docs](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs/blob/main/local-rendering.md)\n\n### Content directory/repository\n\nTo use NEBULA to build the content in this repository locally, you will need to clone this repository and the NEBULA repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support.git\ngit clone git@github.com:esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA.git\n```\n\n### Link to the content repository\n\nTo make sure that NEBULA knows where to find the content, we create the following environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport CONTENT_PATH=\"/path/to/your/content/repository\"\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\n\nCheck whether you have node and npm installed:\n```bash\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n```\nThe above commands should output the installed versions, *e.g.*, `10.6.0` and `v20.9.0`.\n\nIf this is not the case, proceed with installing the [node package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).\n\nFirst, [use nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script), the \"node version manager\", this is a shell script that enables the installation, management and use of multiple versions of the node runtime environment and package manager.\n\n```bash\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n```\n\nNow, install the the node Javascript runtime environment which includes the node package manager (npm):\n```bash\nnvm install node\n```\n\nFinally, you can use npm (node package manager) to install the dependencies of NEBULA. Navigate to the NEBULA respository:\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/NEBULA/repository\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Local development build\n\nStart the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:\n\n```bash\n# node package manager\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNow you can open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/research-software-support`\n"}]
