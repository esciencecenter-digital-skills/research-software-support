Smoke Test        |       | A. Style of testing that focuses on retesting after changes are made. The results of tests after the changes are compared to the results before, and errors are raised if these are different. The purpose of this test is to ensure that changes (enhancements or defect fixes) to the software have not adversely affected it. |\n| 2. Unit Test         |       | B. A level of the software testing process where the complete, integrated system is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate whether the system as a whole gives the correct outputs for given inputs. |\n| 3. Integration Test  |       | C. Very brief initial checks that ensure the basic units required to run the software can be initialized. If these fail there is no point proceeding to additional levels of testing until they are fixed. |\n| 4. System Test       |       | D. A level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. |\n| 5. Regression Test   |       | E. A level of the software testing process where individual units of a software are tested. The purpose is to ensure that each unit of the software works as expected. | \n\n---\n\n## Hint\n\nHereâ€™s an analogy: during the process of manufacturing a ballpoint pen, the cap, the body, the tail, the ink cartridge and the ballpoint are produced separately and unit tested separately. When two or more units are ready, they are assembled and integration testing is performed, for example a test to check the cap fits on the body. When the complete pen is integrated, system testing is performed to check it can be used to write like any pen should.\n\n<small> correct answers: 1.C., 2.E., 3.D., 4.B., and 5.A </small>\n\n"},{"_path":"/modules/testing","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software Testing","description":"A cut-out of the following image:","category":"Developing Software","order":4,"abstract":"Local testing of your software and using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)","author":"eScience Center","thumbnail":"thumbnail-testing.jpg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:testing:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/testing/index.md","_stem":"modules/testing/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Software Testing\ncategory: Developing Software\norder: 4\nabstract: Local testing of your software and using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\nauthor: eScience Center\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-testing.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\nA cut-out of the following image:\n\nCrash test dummy in a 2010 Hyundai Tucson GLS at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Vehicle Research Center.\nThis file is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en) license.\n[thumbnail-testing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IIHS_crash_test_dummy_in_Hyundai_Tucson.jpg)\nPhoto by Brady Holt"}]
