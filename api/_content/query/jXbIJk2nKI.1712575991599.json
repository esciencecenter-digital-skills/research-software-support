There will be some conditions attached, which depend on the particular license used."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are a handful of Open Source licenses available, with different terms. Those differences are especially important when you use a package or library in your own software.

That's actually the Free Software definition, but Open Source really just says the same thing in more words, which is why they're usually mentioned together. These are exactly the permissions scientists need to be able to do science together using the software."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Open Source licenses also allow commercial use, which means that they are a very effective means of technology transfer. Since the license terms are the same for everyone, there are no issues with state aid regulations, nor does a market-rate value for the software need to be determined. The standard Open Source licenses are now well understood and trusted by commercial parties, removing the need for complex negotiations on the exact terms. Of course, no payment will be received either. Given that commercial sale of academic software is very rare, it seems that the benefits obtained from the academic collaboration enabled by Open Source far outweigh the potential income loss due to not commercially licensing the software. And note that it is still perfectly possible to launch a spin-off or start-up that offers commercial services related to the software, including support and continued development."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"hr","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"http://www.esciencecenter.nl","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"www.esciencecenter.nl"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"mailto:info@esciencecenter.nl"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"info@esciencecenter.nl"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"020 - 460 47 70"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"software-licensing","depth":2,"text":"Software Licensing"},{"id":"about-copyright","depth":2,"text":"About copyright"},{"id":"using-others-software","depth":2,"text":"Using others' software"},{"id":"who-owns-a-work","depth":2,"text":"Who owns a work?"},{"id":"why-license-your-software","depth":2,"text":"Why license your software?"},{"id":"open-sourcing-scientific-software","depth":2,"text":"Open Sourcing scientific software"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"github:modules:licenses:media:slides-licenses.md","_source":"github","_file":"modules/licenses/media/slides-licenses.md","_extension":"md"}]
