If you are interested in following or even hosting such a masterclass, have a look at the [training page](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/digital-skills/) or contact the [training team](mailto:training@esciencecenter.nl) at the Netherlands eScience Center.\n\n## Homework\n\n### Research Software\n\n1. Find a piece of research software that you like (because of the topic or nice picture, or whetever other reason) from the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/software?page=1&rows=48).\n\n1. Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n\n"},{"_path":"/modules/citation/citationcff","_dir":"citation","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"CITATION.cff file","description":"","type":"reading","order":4,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:citation:citationcff.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/citation/citationcff.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: CITATION.cff file\ntype: reading\norder: 4\n---\n\n## The `CITATION.cff` file\n\nTo facilitate the citation of scientific software, a group of software developers, researchers, and publishers have come together to develop the `CITATION.cff` format. A `CITATION.cff` file is a lightweight, machine-readable file that provides information about the software, its creators, and how it should be cited. This file can be included in the software, and should be easy to find and access.\n\nThere are even nice integrations with GitHub and Zenodo. \n\nHere is an example of a `CITATION.cff` file:\n\n```\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n  - family-names: Druskat\n    given-names: Stephan\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/1234-5678-9101-1121\ntitle: \"My Research Software\"\nversion: 2.0.4\nidentifiers:\n  - type: doi\n    value: 10.5281/zenodo.1234\ndate-released: 2021-08-11\n```\n"}]
