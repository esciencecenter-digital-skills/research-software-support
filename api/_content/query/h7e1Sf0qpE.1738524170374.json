What happens and why?\n  - Add a function that subtracts items rather than adding them. What happens now if you use words instead of numbers, and why?\n  - What else can you do?\n\n### If you have experience in writing software:\n\n- Buddy up with someone from the above group.\n- Use the 4-eye principle (pair programming), to watch what they are doing and help them figure out what is going on and why.\n- Try to be conscious in explaining what is important and what your buddy needs to know without overcomplicating matters or taking over the keyboard.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/researchsoftware","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"What is (Research) Software?","description":"thumbnail-research-software","category":"Getting Started","order":0,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":"What is software, how is it made and what makes research software so special?","thumbnail":"thumbnail-research-software.png","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:researchsoftware:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/researchsoftware/index.md","_stem":"modules/researchsoftware/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: What is (Research) Software?\ncategory: Getting Started\norder: 0\nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: What is software, how is it made and what makes research software so special?\nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-research-software.png\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n[thumbnail-research-software](https://unsplash.com/photos/colorful-software-or-web-code-on-a-computer-monitor-Skf7HxARcoc?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/colorful-software-or-web-code-on-a-computer-monitor-Skf7HxARcoc?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>\n\n\n\n\n"}]
