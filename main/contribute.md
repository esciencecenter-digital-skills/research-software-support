## Contributing to the Research Software Support

In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.
This, as you can imagine, is no easy feat, and we need your help!
So first of all, thank you very much for your interest in contributing to this project.

### What can I do?

Go to our github repository by clicking on the GitHub logo in the top right of this website. 

* Contribute to the content discussion in the [chapter issues](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astory), e.g. by listing good resources for information.
* [Author a lesson](#elements-of-a-module), e.g. by:
  * [Creating slides](#slides)
  * [Designing an exercise](#exercises)
  * [Curating online resources](#online-resources)
* Review a lesson module; both by looking at [open PRs](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/pulls), as well as flagging issues for improvement in the [existing content](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/research-software-support/).
* [Provide feedback](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/research-software-support/issues) on the different subjects covered: what did we miss? Should something be restructured?
