Find a piece of research software that you like (because of the topic or nice picture, or whetever other reason) from the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/software?page=1&rows=48).\n\n1. Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Explore software management plans fitting your piece of software by using the [Exploring the SMP Questionnaire](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/smp_questionnaire) exercise in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan and download the Word file.\n",{"_path":4,"_dir":5,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":8,"description":9,"order":10,"body":733,"_type":293,"_id":294,"_source":295,"_file":296,"_stem":297,"_extension":298,"plainText":299},{"type":12,"children":734,"toc":939},[735,739,751,755,774,778,797,801,844,848,883,887,908,912],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":736,"children":737},{"id":18},[738],{"type":21,"value":22},{"type":15,"tag":24,"props":740,"children":741},{},[742],{"type":15,"tag":28,"props":743,"children":744},{},[745,746,750],{"type":21,"value":32},{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":747,"children":748},{"href":36},[749],{"type":21,"value":39},{"type":21,"value":41},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":752,"children":753},{"id":45},[754],{"type":21,"value":48},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":756,"children":757},{},[758,766],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":759,"children":760},{},[761],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":762,"children":764},{"href":59,"rel":763},[61],[765],{"type":21,"value":64},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":767,"children":768},{},[769],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":770,"children":772},{"href":70,"rel":771},[61],[773],{"type":21,"value":74},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":775,"children":776},{"id":77},[777],{"type":21,"value":80},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":779,"children":780},{},[781,789],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":782,"children":783},{},[784],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":785,"children":787},{"href":89,"rel":786},[61],[788],{"type":21,"value":93},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":790,"children":791},{},[792],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":793,"children":795},{"href":99,"rel":794},[61],[796],{"type":21,"value":103},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":798,"children":799},{"id":106},[800],{"type":21,"value":109},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":802,"children":803},{},[804,812,820,828,836],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":805,"children":806},{},[807],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":808,"children":810},{"href":118,"rel":809},[61],[811],{"type":21,"value":122},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":813,"children":814},{},[815],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":816,"children":818},{"href":128,"rel":817},[61],[819],{"type":21,"value":132},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":821,"children":822},{},[823],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":824,"children":826},{"href":138,"rel":825},[61],[827],{"type":21,"value":142},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":829,"children":830},{},[831],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":832,"children":834},{"href":148,"rel":833},[61],[835],{"type":21,"value":152},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":837,"children":838},{},[839],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":840,"children":842},{"href":158,"rel":841},[61],[843],{"type":21,"value":162},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":845,"children":846},{"id":165},[847],{"type":21,"value":168},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":849,"children":850},{},[851,859,867,875],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":852,"children":853},{},[854],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":855,"children":857},{"href":177,"rel":856},[61],[858],{"type":21,"value":181},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":860,"children":861},{},[862],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":863,"children":865},{"href":187,"rel":864},[61],[866],{"type":21,"value":191},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":868,"children":869},{},[870],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":871,"children":873},{"href":197,"rel":872},[61],[874],{"type":21,"value":201},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":876,"children":877},{},[878],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":879,"children":881},{"href":207,"rel":880},[61],[882],{"type":21,"value":211},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":884,"children":885},{"id":214},[886],{"type":21,"value":217},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":888,"children":889},{},[890,899],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":891,"children":892},{},[893,898],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":894,"children":896},{"href":226,"rel":895},[61],[897],{"type":21,"value":230},{"type":21,"value":232},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":900,"children":901},{},[902,907],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":903,"children":905},{"href":238,"rel":904},[61],[906],{"type":21,"value":242},{"type":21,"value":244},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":909,"children":910},{"id":247},[911],{"type":21,"value":250},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":913,"children":914},{},[915,923,931],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":916,"children":917},{},[918],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":919,"children":921},{"href":259,"rel":920},[61],[922],{"type":21,"value":263},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":924,"children":925},{},[926],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":927,"children":929},{"href":269,"rel":928},[61],[930],{"type":21,"value":273},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":932,"children":933},{},[934],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":935,"children":937},{"href":279,"rel":936},[61],[938],{"type":21,"value":283},{"title":7,"searchDepth":285,"depth":285,"links":940},[941,942,943,944,945,946],{"id":45,"depth":285,"text":48},{"id":77,"depth":285,"text":80},{"id":106,"depth":285,"text":109},{"id":165,"depth":285,"text":168},{"id":214,"depth":285,"text":217},{"id":247,"depth":285,"text":250},1763476538902]
