Find a piece of research software that you like (because of the topic or nice picture, or whetever other reason) from the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/software?page=1&rows=48).\n\n1. Do the [exercise about the research life cycle](/modules/researchsoftware/exercise-research-life-cycle) from the Research Software module, use the piece of software you chose.\n\n### Software in the Research landscape\n\n1. From all the different initiatives, concepts and organizations discussed in the [Software Landscape module](/modules/softwarelandscape/slides) or the [Yellow Pages](/main/yellowpages), pick **three** that your chosen piece of software could/should connect to and/or use. \n\n2. Explain why you chose these three and what makes them valuable for the chosen piece of software. \n\n\n### Software Management Plan\n\n1. Create a software management plan template which fits your piece of software by using step 2 and 3 from the [Template Building exercise](/modules/softwaremanagementplans/templatebuilding) in the software management plan module.\n\n2. Fill out your own software management plan template. Keep it short and to the point. \n",{"_path":4,"_dir":5,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":8,"description":9,"order":10,"body":723,"_type":283,"_id":284,"_source":285,"_file":286,"_stem":287,"_extension":288,"plainText":289},{"type":12,"children":724,"toc":921},[725,729,741,745,764,768,787,791,826,830,865,869,890,894],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":726,"children":727},{"id":18},[728],{"type":21,"value":22},{"type":15,"tag":24,"props":730,"children":731},{},[732],{"type":15,"tag":28,"props":733,"children":734},{},[735,736,740],{"type":21,"value":32},{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":737,"children":738},{"href":36},[739],{"type":21,"value":39},{"type":21,"value":41},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":742,"children":743},{"id":45},[744],{"type":21,"value":48},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":746,"children":747},{},[748,756],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":749,"children":750},{},[751],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":752,"children":754},{"href":59,"rel":753},[61],[755],{"type":21,"value":64},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":757,"children":758},{},[759],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":760,"children":762},{"href":70,"rel":761},[61],[763],{"type":21,"value":74},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":765,"children":766},{"id":77},[767],{"type":21,"value":80},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":769,"children":770},{},[771,779],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":772,"children":773},{},[774],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":775,"children":777},{"href":89,"rel":776},[61],[778],{"type":21,"value":93},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":780,"children":781},{},[782],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":783,"children":785},{"href":99,"rel":784},[61],[786],{"type":21,"value":103},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":788,"children":789},{"id":106},[790],{"type":21,"value":109},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":792,"children":793},{},[794,802,810,818],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":795,"children":796},{},[797],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":798,"children":800},{"href":118,"rel":799},[61],[801],{"type":21,"value":122},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":803,"children":804},{},[805],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":806,"children":808},{"href":128,"rel":807},[61],[809],{"type":21,"value":132},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":811,"children":812},{},[813],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":814,"children":816},{"href":138,"rel":815},[61],[817],{"type":21,"value":142},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":819,"children":820},{},[821],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":822,"children":824},{"href":148,"rel":823},[61],[825],{"type":21,"value":152},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":827,"children":828},{"id":155},[829],{"type":21,"value":158},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":831,"children":832},{},[833,841,849,857],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":834,"children":835},{},[836],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":837,"children":839},{"href":167,"rel":838},[61],[840],{"type":21,"value":171},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":842,"children":843},{},[844],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":845,"children":847},{"href":177,"rel":846},[61],[848],{"type":21,"value":181},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":850,"children":851},{},[852],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":853,"children":855},{"href":187,"rel":854},[61],[856],{"type":21,"value":191},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":858,"children":859},{},[860],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":861,"children":863},{"href":197,"rel":862},[61],[864],{"type":21,"value":201},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":866,"children":867},{"id":204},[868],{"type":21,"value":207},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":870,"children":871},{},[872,881],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":873,"children":874},{},[875,880],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":876,"children":878},{"href":216,"rel":877},[61],[879],{"type":21,"value":220},{"type":21,"value":222},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":882,"children":883},{},[884,889],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":885,"children":887},{"href":228,"rel":886},[61],[888],{"type":21,"value":232},{"type":21,"value":234},{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":891,"children":892},{"id":237},[893],{"type":21,"value":240},{"type":15,"tag":50,"props":895,"children":896},{},[897,905,913],{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":898,"children":899},{},[900],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":901,"children":903},{"href":249,"rel":902},[61],[904],{"type":21,"value":253},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":906,"children":907},{},[908],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":909,"children":911},{"href":259,"rel":910},[61],[912],{"type":21,"value":263},{"type":15,"tag":54,"props":914,"children":915},{},[916],{"type":15,"tag":34,"props":917,"children":919},{"href":269,"rel":918},[61],[920],{"type":21,"value":273},{"title":7,"searchDepth":275,"depth":275,"links":922},[923,924,925,926,927,928],{"id":45,"depth":275,"text":48},{"id":77,"depth":275,"text":80},{"id":106,"depth":275,"text":109},{"id":155,"depth":275,"text":158},{"id":204,"depth":275,"text":207},{"id":237,"depth":275,"text":240},1738524869379]
