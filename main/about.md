## About the Research Software Support
In the Research Software Support modules we want to provide a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of research software support.

## Target audience

The target audience for this material is University management and support staff.
University management taking part in courses involving these modules may be involved in creating university policy around research software.
The University support staff targeted are not themselves researchers or software engineers, but they support researchers and research software engineers in creating research software.
